{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

We made two submissions for Subtask 1, with minor difference between them. The only difference is that the second submission includes additional predictions for the unseen German language. Table 4 compares the results of our system and other teams. We see that our system, based on the unsupervised graph-based clustering approach, outperforms the unsupervised baseline system by a large margin in all the languages. We observe a big performance drop for the German language compared to other two languages. One of the reasons for this is due to historical data issues. Unlike the Russian and Finnish corpus usages\\u2014which have been carefully preprocessed by AXOLOTL24 organizers, German usages are not cleaned up and contain spelling variations (e.g., n\\u00f6thig instead of n\\u00f6tig), OCR errors, escaping double quotes and others. These issues would incur out-of-vocabulary tokens, potentially resulting in poor performance.\\n\\nLastly, our system performs poorly in terms of ARI on both Russian and German test sets, despite having better scores in macro-F1. The performance gap between F1 and ARI attributes to the scope mismatch between the two metrics: new sense IDs are excluded when computing F1, whereas both old and novel sense IDs are considered when computing ARI. This means unlike ARI, F1 would not penalize wrong prediction of novel sense IDs. As a result, although our system performs poorly for novel sense predictions in Russian (see the ARI_new result in Table 6), the F1 result $_{\\\\mathrm{Fl=0.570}}$ ) is still quite high.\\nTable 6: Post-evaluation results of our system on the test-phase leaderboard for AXOLOTL-24 Subtask 1. ARI_new considers new sense IDs only, while ARI_old focuses on old sense IDs.\\nNote that the results from our system and other teams are not directly comparable as the system details of other teams are missing. For instance, it remains unclear whether their systems are unsupervised or not. Overall, we see the deep-change system achieves the best performance in all the three languages (including the unseen German language where train and dev sets are unavailable); however, their achievement is made through a total of 33 submissions and the leaderboard only reports their best performance; this indicates overftting.\\nSubtask 2. We refned our prompts for instructing GPT-3.5-turbo. This results in three submissions we made for Subtask 2, where the prompts in our fnal submission yield the best performance on the randomly selected instances from the Finnish and Russian dev sets. Note that the fnal prompts are the Finnish, Russian and German translations from the English version (see Figure 6).\\n\\nDespite not using train sets, our unsupervised system, based on GPT-3.5-turbo, considerably outperforms the supervised baseline system in all setups (see Table 5). This might be because the train sets are not large enough for fne-tuning XGLM (Lin et al., 2022). When compared with other teams, our system ranks frst for Finnish and German, and ranks second for Russian. Again, it is unclear whether other teams take advantage of the train sets, and thus the direct comparison with other systems is not meaningful.\\nComparison of LLMs. Figure 7 compares the results of several LLMs. Overall, we observe that our unsupervised system based on LLMs greatly outperforms the supervised baseline system in terms of BERTScore. However, our system performs worse than the baseline in BLEU. This is because our generated defnitions are not lexically but semantically similar to their ground-truth counterparts. The reason for this is the following: BLEU cannot recognize text pair similarity when there is no lexical overlap between them (Reiter, 2018). This is particularly problematic when dealing with morphologically rich languages like Russian and Finnish. In such languages, high-quality generated defnitions might differ greatly from ground-truth defnitions in morphological forms; in this case, BLEU would wrongly assign low scores to highquality defnitions due to the absence of lexical overlap. This is demonstrated by our results, where BLEU scores (0.02-0.03) mean very few lexical overlaps between the generated and ground-truth defnitions while BERTScore (0.65-0.67) suggest that defnition pairs are indeed semantically similar.\\n\\nAdditionally, we observe the supervised baseline system performs best in terms of BLEU, particularly for Russian. This means the generated defnitions are lexically similar to the ground-truth. This might be attributed to the memorization of training sets. We see that many ground-truth defnitions contain words from corpus usages. During training, the baseline system might have learned to prioritize the use of words from corpus usages when generating defnitions. Lastly, although GPT4-turbo has shown to greatly outperform GPT-3.5- turbo in many NLP tasks, we demonstrate that the superiority of GPT-4-turbo is not considerable in Subtask 2, especially for Russian, so is the case for LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B.\"}\n{\"score\":35.9427,\"pdf_id\":\"55bc6198-c2b1-518f-9612-8d58ec050f2f\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"60d25713-701f-57c7-943c-ac30f9f1cf7d\",\"text\":\"Datasets. The shared task provides datasets for the two subtasks for Finnish, Russian and German languages. These datasets contain dictionary entries such as headwords (target words), the defnitions of their meanings, word usages, the positions of the headwords within word usages, and time period (indicating whether word usages belong to an earlier or later time period).\\nFor Finnish, the dataset is curated from Vanhan kirjasuomen sanakirja (Dictionary of Old Literary Finnish)10 and is split into train, dev and test sets. It includes word usages from earlier and later time periods (before 1700 and after 1700). For Russian, the dataset from an earlier time period is sourced from Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language (Dal, 1955) while the dataset from a later period is from CODWOE (Mickus et al., 2022). Again, the dataset is divided into train, dev and test sets. For German, the dataset is collected from DWUG DE Sense (Schlechtweg, 2023). The German dataset is only available in the test phase, meaning that no train and dev sets are provided. This setup is to put submitted systems to test in handling an unseen language. We provide data statistics for the AXOLOTL24 shared task in Table 3, where the data from earlier and later time periods are treated as two separate corpora.\\nImplementation details in Subtask 1. The baseline system is unsupervised, although it still requires a number of hyperparameters. These hyperparameters include a threshold for the minimum similarity between a word usage and a dictionary defnition based on their embeddings, as well as parameters required by Affnity Propagation, such as the choice of distance metrics to compute distances between clusters and the number of clustering iterations. The baseline system sets the similarity threshold to 0.3 and keeps the default parameters of Affnity Propagation unchanged for all languages. For our submitted system, two predefned hyperparameters are needed: the similarity threshold as for the baseline system, and the number of nearest neighbors required for generating a semantic graph and computing distances between clusters. After tuning on the development sets, we set the similarity threshold to 0.5 and the number of nearest neighbors to 5 for all languages. On a side note, the baseline system uses the sentence-level encoder LEALLA (Mao and Nakagawa, 2023) to produce word usage embeddings while our system uses the word-level encoder m-BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to produce both word and word usage embeddings.\\nImplementation details in Subtask 2. The baseline system is supervised and fnetunes the model parameters of XGLM (Lin et al., 2022) in the task of generating defnitions for word usages. Doing so requires several hyperparameters, including learning rate and weight decay for the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), and the number of epochs for training. The baseline system uses the default parameters of the Adam optimizer and sets the number of epochs to 1. Our submitted system, on the contrary, is fully unsupervised. For each target word, we take a set of word usages identifed by our clustering approach in Subtask 1 and prompt LLMs to generate a collective defnition for the usages of the target word. A predefned prompt is needed and we provide it in Figure 6. For LLMs, we experiment with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-turbo, LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B.\\nPrompt engineering. Note that our prompt is created from scratch and refned on a small selection of random instances in the development sets, meaning that our prompt is not optimal for the entire sets in any language. Our refnement process starts with an English prompt to instruct LLMs to generate Finnish, Russian and German defnitions; however, LLMs often generate English definitions for non-English word usages; we address this by translating the English prompt into Finnish, Russian and German via Google Translate. Other factors for refnement include (a) the length of a defnition, (b) determining when to stop generation in order to ensure that generated defnitions are comparable in length to the ground-truth counterparts, and (c) the number of word usages for LLMs to generate a collective defnition.\\n\\nEvaluation. For Subtask 1, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985) and macro-F1 score are the two evaluation metrics for reporting and comparing system performances. ARI calculates how much a pair of word usages from the predictions belong to the same sense ID (or different sense IDs) as they should, while the macro-F1 score computes the precision and recall of word usages for each sense ID and then averages these scores across all sense IDs. Note that F1 only considers old senses in the \\u201cnew\\u201d time period, meaning that mappings of word usages to novel senses are not evaluated. ARI considers both novel and old senses in the \\u201cnew\\u201d time period.\\nFor Subtask 2, generated defnitions for those usages with novel senses are compared to their ground-truth counterparts by computing similarities between defnition pairs. The AXOLOTL-24 shared task uses both lexical-based and embeddingbased metrics to compute defnition pair similarities. The metrics considered are BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and BERTScore (Zhang\\\\* et al., 2020). Other metrics appropriate for doing so include MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019), BlonDe (Jiang et al., 2022) and DiscoScore (Zhao et al., 2023). The latter two metrics have shown to be well-suited for computing long-text pair similarities, particularly useful when dealing with lengthy defnitions.\"}\n{\"score\":16.3449,\"pdf_id\":\"55bc6198-c2b1-518f-9612-8d58ec050f2f\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"41c49bd0-c2bd-5ba7-8f77-aaacb7191b1f\",\"text\":\"This section reviews semantic change detection and discuss its potential connections with dictionaries.\\nLexical Semantic Change Detection (LSCD) focuses on the automatic identifcation of shifts in word meanings over time. For instance, the word \\u2018chill\\u2019 used to mean \\u2018cold\\u2019 for individuals growing up in the 60s, but for those in the 90s, it means \\u2018relaxed\\u2019. Many works proposed to detect meaning shifts by using static or contextualized embeddings (Eger and Mehler, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2016a,b; Martinc et al., 2020; Gonen et al., 2020; Kaiser et al., 2021; Montariol et al., 2021a; Teodorescu et al., 2022; Homskiy and Arefyev, 2022). Most work in LSCD has been done on an unsupervised task formulation (Schlechtweg et al., 2020) which neither involved a dictionary, nor providing interpretation or qualifcation of detected sense changes. While early work on static embeddings (Kim et al., 2014; Hamilton et al., 2016c) could qualify changes to a certain extent through nearest neighbors, it usually did not provide sense clusters in a dictionarylike manner. More recent work straightforwardly enables the induction of sense clusters through clustering of contextualized embeddings (Giulianelli et al., 2020; Kudisov and Arefyev, 2022; Montariol et al., 2021b; Arefyev and Bykov, 2021). More recently, Ma et al. (2024) presented a graph-based clustering approach to detect gained word senses with low frequency, and offered interpretability by visualizing cross-language semantic changes. The works by Giulianelli et al. (2023); Fedorova et al. (2024a) offer new ways of interpretability such as automatically generating sense defnitions for usages from clusters. For an overview of recent model architectures incl. clustering approaches, see Zamora-Reina et al. (2022).\\nLSCD and dictionaries. The above-described approaches all have in common that they do not involve a dictionary in their task formulation. However, a variety of dictionaries is available for different languages and time periods (e.g. Dal, 1955; Paul, 2002; OED, 2009) providing valuable information characterizing a language stage on the lexical level. Thus, a possible alternative task formulation for LSCD is to start from an existing dictionary and compare corpus usages against the dictionary entries in order to fnd usages not covered by the dictionary (Erk, 2006; Lautenschlager et al., 2024).\"}\n{\"score\":15.6559,\"pdf_id\":\"55bc6198-c2b1-518f-9612-8d58ec050f2f\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"4e9988c0-7359-5d84-a9a6-74547887d4f5\",\"text\":\"There has been a surge of interest in computational modeling of semantic change.

We evaluate our system in the AXOLOTL-24 shared task for Finnish, Russian and German languages (Fedorova et al., 2024b). Our system is fully unsupervised. It leverages a graph-based clustering approach to predict mappings between unknown word usages and dictionary entries for Subtask 1, and generates dictionary-like defnitions for those novel word usages through the state-of-the-art Large Language Models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 for Subtask 2. In Subtask 1, our system outperforms the baseline system by a large margin, and it offers interpretability for the mapping results by distinguishing between matched and unmatched (novel) word usages through our graph-based clustering approach. Our system ranks frst in Finnish and German, and ranks second in Russian on the Subtask 2 test-phase leaderboard. These results show the potential of our system in managing dictionary entries, particularly for updating dictionaries to include novel sense entries.

We reuse the workfow of the AXOLOTL-24 baseline system, which includes the following three components that are executed sequentially:\\n\\u2022 Producing embeddings of word usages: This component aims to encode the usages of a target word.\\n\\u2022 Clustering embeddings: This component is to partition the resulting embeddings of a target word into clusters. Each cluster contains embeddings with similar meanings.\\n\\u2022 Mapping between dictionary sense entries and clusters: This component is to align dictionary sense entries with the resulting clusters. If the semantic meaning represented by a cluster is present in dictionaries, then we assign the dictionary entry to that cluster. Otherwise, a novel meaning is said to be identifed. This implies the need for dictionary updates to include new sense entries.\\nBaseline. The baseline system proposes an unsupervised approach that does not rely on training data, i.e., the lack of mappings between word usages at an earlier time period and dictionary sense entries, to predict mappings for unknown word usages at a later period. The idea for the baseline system to implement the workfow is the following: For each target word, the baseline system begins with collecting all the relevant corpus usages available at an earlier time period. If corpus usages are unavailable5, the system resorts to using dictionary defnitions of the target word as substitutes. Secondly, the system aims to encode the meanings of the target word in various corpus usages. However, doing so is not trivial, as the positions of the target word in corpus usages are not always given in the AXOLOTL-24 datasets. Moreover, for morphologically rich languages, the automatic process of locating the target word in word usages is inaccurate. Thus, the baseline system approaches the meaning of a target word by using the sentence encoder LEALLA (Mao and Nakagawa, 2023) to produce the embedding for the entire word usage.\\nAfter collecting word usage embeddings, the baseline system leverages a popular clustering approach known as Affnity Propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007) to group word usage embeddings into several clusters. Each cluster contains multiple embeddings with similar meanings.\\nLastly, to map between dictionary sense entries with unknown usages of a target word at a later time period, the baseline system proposes to align dictionary entries with the collective meaning of each cluster. In particular, for each cluster, the system chooses the embedding of the frst-indexed usage of the target word in the AXOLOTL-24 datasets as the collective meaning represented by that cluster. It then computes the cosine similarity between that word usage embedding and the embedding of each dictionary entry (i.e., sense gloss). If the similarity score surpasses a predefned threshold, then all the word usages within that cluster are said to be matching that dictionary entry.\\nOur submitted system. Just like the baseline system, our system also does not rely on training data to predict mappings between unknown usages at a later time period and dictionary entries. However, we make substantial changes to each component of the workfow.\\nFor each target word, we produce word usage embeddings6 by using m-BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to encode various corpus usages of the target word. Moreover, we create a vocabulary containing all the words available in the entire corpus, together with their average BERT-based word embeddings over their occurrences in the corpus. We take all the word usage embeddings of a target word and the vocabulary as input to derive a 3-layer semantic graph for each target word through our clustering method. Each semantic graph contains the following elements:\\n\\u2022 Root node represents the average word usage embedding over all the usages of a target word\\nin the corpus.\\n\\u2022 Nodes on the second layer are centroids of each sense cluster, i.e., the average of word usage embeddings within each cluster.\\n\\u2022 Nodes on the third layer are $\\\\mathbf{k}$ -nearest neighbors to each cluster centroid.\\nNote that our clustering only operates on embeddings, and the nodes on the second layer are built upon the clustering result. We introduce such a graph as a visualization tool after clustering to separate sense clusters and the corresponding word usages. See a two-dimensional illustration in Figure 3\\u2014where the graph separates a recorded word sense from an unrecorded (novel) sense, together with their word usages from the Finnish AXOLOTL-24 dev set.\\nLastly, to map dictionary entries to clusters, our system differs from the baseline: Instead of choosing the frst-indexed word usage embedding as the collective meaning of a cluster, our system does so by using the average word usage embedding. Here, we briefy outline our clustering approach. For further details, we refer to Ma et al. (2024).\\nClustering. For each target word $w$ , we denote $\\\\mathcal{C}_{w}=\\\\{c_{1},c_{2},\\\\ldots,c_{n}\\\\}$ as a word cloud consisting of a set of $d$ -dimensional embeddings. Each embedding represents a corpus usage of the target word, and $n$ denotes the number of word usages available in a given corpus that contain that target word. We aim to partition $\\\\mathcal{C}_{w}$ into $m$ clusters. Each cluster contains a subset of $\\\\mathcal{C}_{w}$ representing embeddings of word usages with similar meanings. Our clustering method is illustrated in Algorithm 1. We choose our clustering over the baseline Affnity Propagation (Frey and Dueck, 2007) because target words in the AXOLOTL-24 datasets have 2-23 usages on average (c.f. Table 3), i.e., they only have lowfrequency senses; in such a setup, our clustering largely outperforms Affnity Propagation (see Table 11 in Ma et al. (2024)). We present our clustering details in the following:\"}\n\nIn total, 5 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

We made two submissions for Subtask 1, with minor difference between them. The only difference is that the second submission includes additional predictions for the unseen German language. Table 4 compares the results of our system and other teams. We see that our system, based on the unsupervised graph-based clustering approach, outperforms the unsupervised baseline system by a large margin in all the languages. We observe a big performance drop for the German language compared to other two languages. One of the reasons for this is due to historical data issues. Unlike the Russian and Finnish corpus usages\\u2014which have been carefully preprocessed by AXOLOTL24 organizers, German usages are not cleaned up and contain spelling variations (e.g., n\\u00f6thig instead of n\\u00f6tig), OCR errors, escaping double quotes and others. These issues would incur out-of-vocabulary tokens, potentially resulting in poor performance.\\n\\nLastly, our system performs poorly in terms of ARI on both Russian and German test sets, despite having better scores in macro-F1. The performance gap between F1 and ARI attributes to the scope mismatch between the two metrics: new sense IDs are excluded when computing F1, whereas both old and novel sense IDs are considered when computing ARI. This means unlike ARI, F1 would not penalize wrong prediction of novel sense IDs. As a result, although our system performs poorly for novel sense predictions in Russian (see the ARI_new result in Table 6), the F1 result $_{\\\\mathrm{Fl=0.570}}$ ) is still quite high.\\nTable 6: Post-evaluation results of our system on the test-phase leaderboard for AXOLOTL-24 Subtask 1. ARI_new considers new sense IDs only, while ARI_old focuses on old sense IDs.\\nNote that the results from our system and other teams are not directly comparable as the system details of other teams are missing. For instance, it remains unclear whether their systems are unsupervised or not. Overall, we see the deep-change system achieves the best performance in all the three languages (including the unseen German language where train and dev sets are unavailable); however, their achievement is made through a total of 33 submissions and the leaderboard only reports their best performance; this indicates overftting.\\nSubtask 2. We refned our prompts for instructing GPT-3.5-turbo. This results in three submissions we made for Subtask 2, where the prompts in our fnal submission yield the best performance on the randomly selected instances from the Finnish and Russian dev sets. Note that the fnal prompts are the Finnish, Russian and German translations from the English version (see Figure 6).\\n\\nDespite not using train sets, our unsupervised system, based on GPT-3.5-turbo, considerably outperforms the supervised baseline system in all setups (see Table 5). This might be because the train sets are not large enough for fne-tuning XGLM (Lin et al., 2022). When compared with other teams, our system ranks frst for Finnish and German, and ranks second for Russian. Again, it is unclear whether other teams take advantage of the train sets, and thus the direct comparison with other systems is not meaningful.\\nComparison of LLMs. Figure 7 compares the results of several LLMs. Overall, we observe that our unsupervised system based on LLMs greatly outperforms the supervised baseline system in terms of BERTScore. However, our system performs worse than the baseline in BLEU. This is because our generated defnitions are not lexically but semantically similar to their ground-truth counterparts. The reason for this is the following: BLEU cannot recognize text pair similarity when there is no lexical overlap between them (Reiter, 2018). This is particularly problematic when dealing with morphologically rich languages like Russian and Finnish. In such languages, high-quality generated defnitions might differ greatly from ground-truth defnitions in morphological forms; in this case, BLEU would wrongly assign low scores to highquality defnitions due to the absence of lexical overlap. This is demonstrated by our results, where BLEU scores (0.02-0.03) mean very few lexical overlaps between the generated and ground-truth defnitions while BERTScore (0.65-0.67) suggest that defnition pairs are indeed semantically similar.\\n\\nAdditionally, we observe the supervised baseline system performs best in terms of BLEU, particularly for Russian. This means the generated defnitions are lexically similar to the ground-truth. This might be attributed to the memorization of training sets. We see that many ground-truth defnitions contain words from corpus usages. During training, the baseline system might have learned to prioritize the use of words from corpus usages when generating defnitions. Lastly, although GPT4-turbo has shown to greatly outperform GPT-3.5- turbo in many NLP tasks, we demonstrate that the superiority of GPT-4-turbo is not considerable in Subtask 2, especially for Russian, so is the case for LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B.\"}\n{\"score\":63.7482,\"pdf_id\":\"55bc6198-c2b1-518f-9612-8d58ec050f2f\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"60d25713-701f-57c7-943c-ac30f9f1cf7d\",\"text\":\"Datasets. The shared task provides datasets for the two subtasks for Finnish, Russian and German languages. These datasets contain dictionary entries such as headwords (target words), the defnitions of their meanings, word usages, the positions of the headwords within word usages, and time period (indicating whether word usages belong to an earlier or later time period).\\nFor Finnish, the dataset is curated from Vanhan kirjasuomen sanakirja (Dictionary of Old Literary Finnish)10 and is split into train, dev and test sets. It includes word usages from earlier and later time periods (before 1700 and after 1700). For Russian, the dataset from an earlier time period is sourced from Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language (Dal, 1955) while the dataset from a later period is from CODWOE (Mickus et al., 2022). Again, the dataset is divided into train, dev and test sets. For German, the dataset is collected from DWUG DE Sense (Schlechtweg, 2023). The German dataset is only available in the test phase, meaning that no train and dev sets are provided. This setup is to put submitted systems to test in handling an unseen language. We provide data statistics for the AXOLOTL24 shared task in Table 3, where the data from earlier and later time periods are treated as two separate corpora.\\nImplementation details in Subtask 1. The baseline system is unsupervised, although it still requires a number of hyperparameters. These hyperparameters include a threshold for the minimum similarity between a word usage and a dictionary defnition based on their embeddings, as well as parameters required by Affnity Propagation, such as the choice of distance metrics to compute distances between clusters and the number of clustering iterations. The baseline system sets the similarity threshold to 0.3 and keeps the default parameters of Affnity Propagation unchanged for all languages. For our submitted system, two predefned hyperparameters are needed: the similarity threshold as for the baseline system, and the number of nearest neighbors required for generating a semantic graph and computing distances between clusters. After tuning on the development sets, we set the similarity threshold to 0.5 and the number of nearest neighbors to 5 for all languages. On a side note, the baseline system uses the sentence-level encoder LEALLA (Mao and Nakagawa, 2023) to produce word usage embeddings while our system uses the word-level encoder m-BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to produce both word and word usage embeddings.\\nImplementation details in Subtask 2. The baseline system is supervised and fnetunes the model parameters of XGLM (Lin et al., 2022) in the task of generating defnitions for word usages. Doing so requires several hyperparameters, including learning rate and weight decay for the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014), and the number of epochs for training. The baseline system uses the default parameters of the Adam optimizer and sets the number of epochs to 1. Our submitted system, on the contrary, is fully unsupervised. For each target word, we take a set of word usages identifed by our clustering approach in Subtask 1 and prompt LLMs to generate a collective defnition for the usages of the target word. A predefned prompt is needed and we provide it in Figure 6. For LLMs, we experiment with GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4-turbo, LLaMA-2-7B and LLaMA-3-8B.\\nPrompt engineering. Note that our prompt is created from scratch and refned on a small selection of random instances in the development sets, meaning that our prompt is not optimal for the entire sets in any language. Our refnement process starts with an English prompt to instruct LLMs to generate Finnish, Russian and German defnitions; however, LLMs often generate English definitions for non-English word usages; we address this by translating the English prompt into Finnish, Russian and German via Google Translate. Other factors for refnement include (a) the length of a defnition, (b) determining when to stop generation in order to ensure that generated defnitions are comparable in length to the ground-truth counterparts, and (c) the number of word usages for LLMs to generate a collective defnition.\\n\\nEvaluation. For Subtask 1, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) (Hubert and Arabie, 1985) and macro-F1 score are the two evaluation metrics for reporting and comparing system performances. ARI calculates how much a pair of word usages from the predictions belong to the same sense ID (or different sense IDs) as they should, while the macro-F1 score computes the precision and recall of word usages for each sense ID and then averages these scores across all sense IDs. Note that F1 only considers old senses in the \\u201cnew\\u201d time period, meaning that mappings of word usages to novel senses are not evaluated. ARI considers both novel and old senses in the \\u201cnew\\u201d time period.\\nFor Subtask 2, generated defnitions for those usages with novel senses are compared to their ground-truth counterparts by computing similarities between defnition pairs. The AXOLOTL-24 shared task uses both lexical-based and embeddingbased metrics to compute defnition pair similarities. The metrics considered are BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and BERTScore (Zhang\\\\* et al., 2020). Other metrics appropriate for doing so include MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019), BlonDe (Jiang et al., 2022) and DiscoScore (Zhao et al., 2023). The latter two metrics have shown to be well-suited for computing long-text pair similarities, particularly useful when dealing with lengthy defnitions.\"}\n{\"score\":43.6362,\"pdf_id\":\"55bc6198-c2b1-518f-9612-8d58ec050f2f\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"4e9988c0-7359-5d84-a9a6-74547887d4f5\",\"text\":\"There has been a surge of interest in computational modeling of semantic change.

Researchers use linguistic tools and methods to identify gained and lost meanings of headwords, and more importantly to interpret these changes by categorizing the types of changes and detecting social and cultural forces driving the changes.\\n\\nRecently, there has been scholarly interest in computational modeling of meaning changes as cost-effcient alternatives to labor-intensive linguistic tools and methods. As a result, a plateau of research outputs has been made, including shared tasks and datasets (e.g. Schlechtweg et al., 2020; Kutuzov and Pivovarova, 2021; Zamora-Reina et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Schlechtweg et al., 2024a), models (Eger and Mehler, 2016; Hamilton et al., 2016a,b; Martinc et al., 2020; Kaiser et al., 2021; Montariol et al., 2021a; Teodorescu et al., 2022; Cassotti et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024), tools (Schlechtweg et al., 2024b), and relevant workshops2. For instance, SemEval2020 Task 1 (Schlechtweg et al., 2020), a seminal work on this topic, introduces the frst task and datasets on unsupervised lexical semantic change detection in English, German, Swedish and Latin languages. Further extensions include DIACR-Ita for Italian (Basile et al., 2020), RuShiftEval for Russian (Kutuzov and Pivovarova, 2021), and LSCDiscovery for Spanish (Zamora-Reina et al., 2022).\\n\\nThe immediate impact of these research outputs might be on the lexicography industry. Lexicographers rely on collocations and grammatical patterns to identify novel meanings that are not included in dictionaries, and add these identifed meanings into the next iteration of dictionary updates (Kilgarriff et al., 2010). However, the process of doing so is costly and time-consuming. For instance, in 2023, the Oxford English Dictionary created about 1,700 new meanings3, with the help of hundreds of language specialists for English alone. Recently, the AXOLOTL-24 shared task has connected lexical semantic change detection with dictionary entries. Instead of just detecting meaning change, the shared task aims to align dictionary sense entries with each word usage. This is particularly useful for managing dictionary entries, e.g., to identify and collect novel meanings not covered by dictionaries (Erk, 2006; Lautenschlager et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we participate in two AXOLOTL24 subtasks for Finnish, Russian and German languages. The tasks include (a) bridging diachronic word uses and a synchronic dictionary and (b) defnition generation for novel word senses. The frst subtask aims to predict mappings between dictionary meaning entries and word usages while the second task plans to produce dictionary-like defnitions for those unmatched usages with novel word meanings not covered by dictionaries. In the following, we outline the components of our system:\\n\\u2022 For Subtask 1, we keep the workfow of the AXOLOTL-24 baseline system unchanged, which includes three components: producing embeddings for word usages, clustering these embeddings, and mapping between dictionary meaning entries and the resulting clusters.
