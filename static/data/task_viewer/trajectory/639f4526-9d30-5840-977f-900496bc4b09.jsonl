{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In this paper, we show that poor self-correction performance stems from LLMs\\u2019 inability to find logical mistakes, rather than their ability to correct a known mistake. Firstly, we benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on their mistake-finding ability and demonstrate that they generally struggle with the task, even in highly objective, unambiguous cases. Secondly, we test the correction abilities of LLMs \\u2013 separately from mistake finding \\u2013 using a backtracking setup that feeds ground truth mistake location information to the model. We show that this boosts downstream task performance across our 5 reasoning tasks, indicating that LLMs\\u2019 correction abilities are robust. Finally, we show that it is possible to obtain mistake location information without ground truth labels or in-domain training data. We train a small classifier with out-of-domain data, which exhibits stronger mistake-finding performance than prompting a large model. We release our dataset of LLM-generated logical mistakes, BIG-Bench Mistake, to enable further research into locating LLM reasoning mistakes.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated the field of NLP in recent years, achieving stateof-the-art performance in a large variety of applications. In particular, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to solve tasks with zero- or few-shot prompting, giving rise to prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), SelfConsistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023), ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), etc.\\n\\nRecent literature on few- or zero-shot prompting has focused on the concept of self-correction, i.e. having an LLM correct its own outputs (Shinn et al., 2023; Miao et al., 2024; Madaan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Saunders et al., 2022). (See Pan et al. (2023) for a review of the literature.)\\nHowever, Huang et al. (2023) note that while self-correction may prove effective for improving model outputs in terms of style and quality, when it comes to reasoning tasks, LLMs struggle to identify and fix errors without external feedback: for example, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) and RCI (Kim et al., 2023) both use ground truth correctness as a signal to halt the self-correction loop. Initially observed by Madaan et al. (2023) on a math dataset, Huang et al. (2023) further demonstrate this shortcoming of self-correction in 2 additional datasets.\\nWhile previous work typically present selfcorrection as a single process, we divide it into mistake finding and output correction to better understand each component individually.\\nMistake finding is a fundamental reasoning skill that has been studied and utilised extensively in philosophy, psychology, and mathematics, spawning concepts such as critical thinking, and logical and mathematical fallacies. One might expect that the ability to find mistakes should also be an important requirement for LLMs. However, our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs currently cannot find mistakes reliably.\\nOutput correction involves partially or completely changing previously generated outputs. With self-correction, this is typically done with outputs generated by the same model (see Pan et al. (2023)). Despite LLMs\\u2019 inability to find mistakes, our results show that they can correct outputs, if given information about the mistake location. While LLMs struggle with mistake-finding in few-shot conditions, we can obtain more reliable mistake location information using a small, trained classifier.\\n\\nOur contributions for this paper are as follows: 1. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, any task can be turned into a mistake-finding task. We collect and release1 to the research community BIGBench Mistake, a dataset of CoT-style traces2 generated using PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023), and annotated according to where the first logical mistake is. To our knowledge, BIG-Bench Mistake is the first dataset of its kind that goes beyond problems in mathematics.\\n2. We produce benchmark results for our dataset to test the reasoning capabilities of five state-ofthe-art LLMs. We demonstrate that these LLMs struggle with mistake finding, even for objective, unambiguous cases. We hypothesise that this is a main contributing factor to LLMs\\u2019 inability to self-correct reasoning errors.\\n3. We test LLMs\\u2019 ability to correct reasoning errors separately from mistake-finding, by feeding to the model the ground truth (or oracle) mistake location information through a backtracking method. We demonstrate that LLMs\\u2019 correction abilities are robust, effectively correcting outputs that are originally incorrect, with minimal effect on outputs that are originally correct.\\n4. We demonstrate that LLMs\\u2019 low accuracy at few-shot mistake-finding can be improved upon without using in-domain training data. As a proof-of-concept, we train a small mistakefinding classifier using out-of-domain data, which performs better than prompting a large model. We leave the development of more sophisticated methods to future work.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"BIG-Bench Mistake contains 2186 sets of CoTstyle traces. Each trace is generated with PaLM 2 Unicorn (Anil et al., 2023), and annotated with the location of the first logical error. Table 1 shows an example trace where the mistake location3 is the 4th step.\\nOur traces span across a set of 5 tasks from the BIG-bench dataset (Srivastava et al., 2023): word sorting, tracking shuffled objects, logical deduction, multi-step arithmetic, and Dyck languages4. CoT prompting is used to prompt PaLM 2 to answer questions from each task. As we wanted to separate our CoT traces into distinct steps, we follow Yao et al. (2022) and generate each step separately, using the newline as a stop token.\\nAll traces are generated with temperature $=0$ . The correctness of answers are determined by exact match. Prompts can be found at https:\\/\\/github. com\\/WHGTyen\\/BIG-Bench-Mistake along with the dataset.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Each generated trace is annotated with the first logical error.

To disambiguate the two types of correctness, we will use the terms correct $.a n s$ and incorrect $.a n s$ to refer to whether the final answer of the trace is correct. Accuracyans would therefore refer to the overall accuracy for the task, based on how many final answers are correct. To refer to whether the trace contains a logical mistake (rather than the correctness of the final answer), we will use correct $.m i s$ and incorrect $.m i s$\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"For 4 of the 5 tasks, we recruit human annotators to go through each trace and identify any errors. Annotators have no domain expertise but are given guidelines5 to complete the task.\\nBefore annotation, we sample a set of 300 traces for each task, where 255 (85%) are incorrectans, and 45 $(15\\\\%)$ are correct $a n s$ . Since human annotation is a limited and expensive resource, we chose this distribution to maximise the number of steps containing mistakes and to prevent over-saturation of correct steps. We also include some correctans traces because some may contain logical errors despite the correct answer, and to ensure that the dataset included examples of correct steps that are near the end of the trace. To account for this skewed distribution, results in section 4 are split according to whether the original trace is ${\\\\mathsf{c o r r e c t}}_{a n s}$ or not.\\nFollowing Lightman et al. (2023), annotators are instructed to go through each step in the trace and indicate whether the step is correct or not (binary choice). Annotators only submit their answers when all steps are annotated, or there is one incorrect step. If an incorrect step is identified, the remaining steps are skipped. This is to avoid ambiguities where a logically correct deduction is dependent on a previous mistake. Our annotation guidelines can be found at https: \\/\\/github.com\\/WHGTyen\\/BIG-Bench-Mistake\\/ tree\\/main\\/annotation_guidelines, and we include a screenshot of the user interface in Appendix D.\\nEach trace is annotated by at least 3 annotators. If there are any disagreements, we take the majority label. We calculate Krippendorff\\u2019s alpha (Hayes and Krippendorff, 2007) to measure inter-rater reliability (see Table 3).\\n\\nTable 3: Inter-rater reliability for the human-annotated tasks, measured by Krippendorff\\u2019s alpha.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"For Dyck languages, we use mostly automatic instead of human annotation, as the traces show limited variation in phrasing and solution paths.\\nFor each trace, we algorithmically generate a set of steps based on the format used in the prompt examples. Using pattern matching, we identify whether each model-generated step conforms to the same format. If so, we compare the two and assume that the trace is incorrect if the symbols do not match. Additionally, we account for edge cases such as where the final two steps are merged into one, or variations in presentation where symbols may or may not be placed in quotes.

A model\\u2019s output is only considered correct if the location matches exactly, or the output correctly indicates that there are no mistakes.\\nAll models are given the same 3-shot prompts5. We use three different prompting methods:\\n\\u2022 Direct trace-level prompting involves using the whole trace as input to the model and directly prompting for the mistake location.

The final answer is inferred from where the first \\\"No\\\" output occurs (subsequent steps are ignored).\\n\\u2022 CoT step-level prompting is an extension of direct, step-level prompting. Instead of a binary Yes\\/No response, we prompt the model to check the (partial) trace through a series of reasoning steps. This method is the most resource intensive of all three methods as it involves generating a whole CoT sequence for every step.

(2023), who show that existing self-correction strategies are ineffective on reasoning errors. In our experiments, we specifically target the models\\u2019 mistake finding ability and provide results for additional tasks. We show that state-of-the-art LLMs clearly struggle with mistake finding, even in the most simple and unambiguous cases. (For comparison, humans can identify mistakes without specific expertise, and have a high degree of agreement, as shown in Table 3.)\\nWe hypothesise that LLMs\\u2019 inability to find mistakes is a main contributing factor to why LLMs are unable to self-correct reasoning errors. If LLMs are unable to identify mistakes, it should be no surprise that they are unable to self-correct either.\\n\\nTable 4: Mistake finding accuracy across 5 tasks.

Our three methods involve generating increasingly complex outputs, starting with direct, trace-level prompting requiring a single token, then direct, step-level prompting requiring one token per step, and finally CoT step-level prompting requiring several sentences per step. If each generation call has some probability of identifying a mistake, then the more calls made on each trace, the more likely the model will identify at least one mistake.\"}\n\n... # only display 10 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_rows (10)"}
