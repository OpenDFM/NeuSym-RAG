{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

To empower the agent\\u2019s decision making capability, we introduce a chain-of-action approach by leveraging a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans to predict actions.\\nThe model architecture of Auto-GUI is illustrated in Figure 2. On a high level, Auto-GUI consists of three stages. First, we acquire encoded features from both vision and language inputs. Specifcally, the vision input, i.e., a screenshot, is encoded by a frozen vision encoder. Meanwhile, the language input, consisting of the goal and a chain of previous action histories\\u2014each history contains a tuple {action type, touch point, lift point, and typed text}, is encoded by a language encoder. Second, the encoded vision and language representations are integrated by a self-attention module. Third, the fused representation is fed to the decoder to generate a chain of future action plans (i.e., action types to execute in future steps) followed by action prediction. A chain of action consists of two parts in the procedure above: a chain of previous action histories on the input side and a chain of future action plans on the output side. In the following, we describe the entire procedure in detail.\\nEncoding Suppose that an episode consists of $k$ steps of interactions. Given a screenshot $X_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}\\\\in$ Rh\\u00d7w\\u00d73 with height h and width w at step t \\u2208 $[1,k]$ , we frst feed it to a frozen image encoder (e.g., BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023)) and extract vision features $H_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{1\\\\times d_{s}}$ where $d_{s}$ is the dimension of the vision features. Additionally, we leverage a language encoder to extract the language features $H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d_{l}}$ of the input goal $X_{\\\\mathrm{goal}}$ where $n$ is the number of tokens and $d_{l}$ is the dimension of the language features. If $t\\\\,>\\\\,1$ , there will be a chain-of-action history already executed before step $t$ . We denote the chain of action histories as $X_{\\\\mathrm{history}}=[m_{1},\\\\ldots,m_{t}]$ where $m_{i}$ contains a tuple of action type, touch point, lift point, and typed text.1 Otherwise, if $t\\\\ =\\\\ 1$ , $X_{\\\\mathrm{history}}$ will be set empty:\\nWe concatenate $X_{\\\\mathrm{goal}}$ and $X_{\\\\mathrm{history}}$ as the input to the language encoder: $\\\\begin{array}{r l}{X_{\\\\mathrm{language}}}&{{}=}\\\\end{array}$ $\\\\{X_{\\\\mathrm{goal}},X_{\\\\mathrm{history}}\\\\}$ .\\nThen, we obtain the encoded representations of the vision and language inputs as follows:\\nwhere $W$ is a trainable projection matrix to convert $H_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}$ into the same dimensionality as $H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}$ .\\nInteraction We correlate $H_{\\\\mathrm{{screen}}}^{'}$ and $H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}$ with a single-head self-attention network (Vaswani et al., 2017),2 where the query $(Q)$ , key $(K)$ , and value $(V)$ are $H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}$ , Hs\\u2032creen, and Hs\\u2032c $H_{\\\\mathrm{{screen}}}^{'}$ reen, respectively. The attention output $H_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}^{\\\\mathrm{attn}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}$ is defned as: $\\\\begin{array}{r}{H_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}^{\\\\mathrm{attn}}=\\\\mathrm{Softmax}(\\\\frac{Q K^{\\\\top}}{\\\\sqrt{d_{k}}})V}\\\\end{array}$ , where $d_{k}$ is the same as the dimension of $H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}$ because a single head is used.\\nThen, a gated fusion (Zhang et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023b) is adopted to fuse\\n$H_{\\\\mathrm{language}}$ and $H_{\\\\mathrm{screen}}^{\\\\mathrm{attn}}$ . We have the fused output $H_{\\\\mathrm{fuse}}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d}$ by:\\nwhere $W_{l}$ and $W_{v}$ are learnable parameters.\\nDecoding The fused representation Hfuse is fed to a Transformer decoder to generate the target predictions in a string format. The target predictions consist of a chain of future action plans $Y_{\\\\mathrm{plan}}$ and the current action prediction $Y_{\\\\mathrm{action}}$ separated by specifc prompts: {Action Plan: $Y_{\\\\mathrm{plan}}$ , Action Decision: $Y_{\\\\mathrm{action}}\\\\}$ Concretely, $Y_{\\\\mathrm{plan}}$ is a chain of action types to execute in future steps: $Y_{\\\\mathrm{plan}}\\\\;=\\\\;[\\\\mathrm{action\\\\_type}_{t},$ . . . , action_type $^{\\\\circ}k$ ]. $Y_{\\\\mathrm{action}}$ contains four components: $Y_{\\\\mathrm{action}}=$ {\\u201caction_type\\u201d: <action_type>, \\u201ctouch_point\\u201d: <touch_point>, \\u201clift_point\\u201d: <lift_point>, \\u201ctyped_text\\u201d: <typed_text>}.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al.,\\n2022; OpenAI, 2023) has fourished promising opportunities for developing autonomous agents to assist users in completing tasks in distinct environments such as operation systems, specifc applications, and web browsers (Adept, 2022; Rawles et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023c; Koh et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023).\\nRecent studies have explored prompt engineering (Richards, 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Reworkd, 2023; Sumers et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023) and fne-tuning techniques (Rawles et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2022) to elicit the capability of language models to execute actions in interactive environments. However, there are at least two major challenges that have limited real-world applications of autonomous agents.\\nFirst, existing approaches commonly rely on external tools such as optical character recognition (OCR) and icon detectors (Zhang et al., 2021; Sunkara et al., 2022) to parse the environment into textual elements (e.g., HTML layouts) as inputs to a language model (Figure 1(a)) (Rawles et al., 2023). On the one hand, the parsed elements generate lengthy inputs, thus leading to inference ineffciency. Since computational latency is a key measure in deployment, using lengthy inputs would increase inference cost and may even exceed the input length limit of the language model. On the other hand, parsing the visual environment into textual elements may also be prone to error propagation or information loss because parsing mistakes are inevitable using external tools.\\nSecond, most existing approaches are under the sand-box setting that requires accessing internal APIs to interact with the environment (Zhou et al., 2023; Gur et al., 2023), e.g., using a JavaScript element selection on a webpage or a Python interpreter to execute actions. However in practice, the API interface is often inaccessible in third-party applications (Apps).\\nThese challenges have motivated more advanced techniques that are capable of frst principles thinking (Aristotle; Irwin, 1989)\\u2014allowing direct interactions on the screen without needing access to intermediate environment parsing or interval application-dependent APIs (Figure 1(b)). To address the challenges, we introduce Auto-GUI, a multimodal approach that directly interacts with the graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To further strengthen the agent\\u2019s action prediction capability, we propose a novel chain-of-action technique, where a chain of action is a series of intermediate previous action histories and future action plans.\\nWe evaluate Auto-GUI on a new device-control benchmark AITW (Rawles et al., 2023) with $30K$ unique instructions, spanning multi-step tasks of application operation, web searching, and web shopping. Experimental results show that AutoGUI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of $90\\\\%$ and an action success rate of $74\\\\%$ .\\nIn summary, our work makes the following technical contributions:\\n(i) We introduce Auto-GUI, a multimodal agent for autonomous GUI control that can directly interact with the screens, thus circumventing the constraints of environment parsing and applicationspecifc API access.\\n(ii) We propose a chain-of-action technique that leverages the previously executed actions and future action plans to help the agent decide what action to execute at each step.\\n(iii) Auto-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance with an action type prediction accuracy of $90\\\\%$ and an action success rate of $74\\\\%$ .
