{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Ground-truth represents the reformulated data gathered from human tutoring present in the test set. Base GPT in Table 3 corresponds to the GPT-4 model bereft of any tutor act classifcation or our human tutoring examples, where its prompt is given in Appendix F. We have also drawn a comparison involving GPT-3.5(gpt-3.5-turbo-16) and GPT-4 in a zero-shot and one-shot confguration. While they all adhere to the identical prompt structure, (as seen in Appendix F), they diverge in aspects such as model compatibility and whether an example scenario is included. Lastly, we compared our two fne-tuned models. Fine-tuned refers to our instruction-tuned model, discussed in the method section 5, which was trained with instruction tasks 1 through 4. Conversely, \\u2019Fine-tuned (ablation)\\u2019 refers to the model trained with instruction tasks 1 and 2 only. We also included a comparison with a potential baseline, denoted as \\u2019Fine-tuned (baseline)\\u2019. This model was trained to sequentially generate the following tutor act and corresponding utterance, conditioned on the given dialogue context without any instructions. This approach is similar to MATHDIAL (Macina et al., 2023a), where the tutoring model was trained to generate utterances given the context and tutor act only.\\n\\nIn assessing the tutor act criteria, our fne-tuned model outperforms other models in both accuracy and invariability as shown in Table 3. Although the accuracy of 0.259 may initially appear low, it\\u2019s important to consider the complexity of choosing from amongst 34 distinct tutor acts. Moreover, a lower invariability score of 5.273 is indicative of our fne-tuned model\\u2019s ability to utilize a wider array of tutor acts, thereby demonstrating more diverse pedagogical approaches. While the invariability score provides one aspect of variability, Figure 3 presents a distribution of chosen tutor acts for the comparative models, which offers a more comprehensive view. Clearly, our fne-tuned model exhibits the greatest number of distinct tutor act classes.\\n\\nWith respect to utterance-related metrics, our fne-tuned model delivers outstanding performances. It records the highest sBLEU score at 15.874 and BERTScore at 0.716, demonstrating its commendable ability in generating utterances that closely mirror the target tutor utterances. While the embedding similarity score of our fne-tuned model is slightly lower than that of GPT-3.5 (1-shot), it still exhibits higher coherence between individual utterances and their corresponding dialogue context.\\nIn terms of the length of the generated utterances, our model closely mimics the length of tutor utterances, whereas the general GPT models often produce unnecessarily long responses. We interpret this as positive, based on the assumption that the appropriate length of a tutor\\u2019s utterance plays a vital role in maintaining student engagement.\\nLastly, the fne-tuned model, trained with tasks 1 through 4, has outperformed the ablation model, which was trained with only partial instruction tasks, and the baseline model, which used simple conditional generation, across all evaluated metrics. This outcome highlights the added value of integrating additional instruction tasks (i.e., tasks 3 and 4) for improved tutoring performance.\"}\n{\"score\":14.5083,\"pdf_id\":\"481d851e-214b-5d6b-af6c-880a1be8f3b9\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"565e0446-80c5-5b10-bec2-57cd2bb6c575\",\"text\":\"The table below is an example of a tutoring session where a human interacts with two tutoring models(GPT-4 1-shot, fne-tuned) each.

Specifcally, LLMs have the potential to teach English as a Second\\/Foreign Language (ESL\\/EFL), for they may serve as readilyavailable tutors that can emulate native-speaking contexts (Park et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2023).\\nHowever, most CITS proposed in literature for teaching ESL are restricted in scope and lack pedagogical depth. For example, works based on CIMA dataset (Stasaski et al., 2020) consider toy concepts of colored shapes and prepositions. Possibly due to limited scope, CIMA only considers a fve tutor act classes (\\u201chint\\u201d, \\u201cquestion\\u201d, \\u201ccorrection\\u201d, \\u201cconfrmation\\u201d, and \\u201cother\\u201d). Similarly, the TSCC dataset (Caines et al., 2022) only considers abstract tutor act classes such as \\u201cscaffolding\\u201d, and does not consider a more granular set of teaching strategies (e.g., inferential clues, teaching synonyms or antonyms, etc.). Consequently, models trained on CIMA (Stasaski et al., 2020) and TSCC (Caines et al., 2022) are limited to employing simplistic instructional strategies (Macina et al., 2023b).\\nThe goal of our work is to develop CITS that can teach ESL by applying pedagogically meaningful teaching strategies adaptively to student\\u2019s needs. To do so, we designed a tutoring session that focuses on comprehending a real news article, covering vocabulary, grammar, and relevant cultural contexts. Based on this, we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically-informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED). For BIPED, we collected a bilingual, oneon-one human-to-human tutoring dataset. Thereafter, we analyzed the dataset post-hoc from a pedagogical viewpoint and developed a categorization of dialogue acts, which comprises 34 tutor acts and 9 student acts. Finally, we annotated the data using the defned dialogue act categories.\\nAs for the development of CITS, we employ the framework (Macina et al., 2023b; Wang et al., 2023a) whereby the LLM frst chooses the suitable tutor act, then generates the corresponding utterance. We believe this approach enables the model to generate a more focused response that does not deviate from the chosen tutor intent. We consider two implementations of such CITS, one based on GPT-4 prompting, and another based on fne-tuning SOLAR-KO 10.7B (L. Junbum, 2024), which is a public model trained on a Korean corpus. For GPT-4, our dataset is used as examples for in-context learning. For fne-tuning, we explored a multi-task learning approach, where the model is instruction-tuned to carry out tutor act prediction and response generation, as well as other tasks for context grounding.\\n\\nIn our experiments, we show through various metrics that the implemented models are capable of mimicking human teacher\\u2019s utterance style, as well as their pedagogical strategies. Specifcally, we show that our models choose appropriate and diverse tutor acts, and generate human-like utterances, as measured by sentence similarity metrics.\\nThe contributions of our paper are as follows:   \\n\\u2022 We provide BIPED, a dataset curated from bilingual human-to-human tutoring dialogues that come annotated with specifc tutoring acts. Importantly, the lesson topic is complex enough to require sophisticated pedagogical methods.   \\n\\u2022 We implement two CITS based on BIPED.
