{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

While all methods show improvement over GPT-3.5-turbo by approximately 0.1 accuracy, DetermLR consistently outperforms all baselines even on the same base model. For the most challenging LogiQA, all baselines including CR perform poorly on this task with accuracy below 46. Since the utilization order of known conditions is crucial to solving the exam problem, baseline methods often fail to grasp the accurate reasoning direction. DetermLR performs well by prioritizing and memorizing known conditions and reasoning steps, resulting in an accuracy of 54.19 with GPT-4. Meanwhile, the average number of reasoning steps in DetermLR reaches 11.74, which is more effcient than CoT-SC, ToT, and CR in solving real logical reasoning examination problems. For ProofWriter and FOLIO, DetermLR can generate more accurate propositions for the target than CoT-SC, ToT, and CR. Also, DetermLR requires fewer reasoning steps to reach the same conclusion, ensuring more effcient premise integration and exploration. The results in LD show that compared to all baseline methods, DetermLR can enhance the accuracy of assigning the order of objects, and substantially reduce the number of reasoning iterations.\"}\n{\"score\":3.4078,\"pdf_id\":\"4f88e7de-b217-5d6b-a315-a872e927bdfe\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"5226ece3-933f-5a18-8c4c-28c1d06383b3\",\"text\":\"Case study. An intuition suggests that problems with more known conditions and longer contexts tend to require more complex reasoning structures. However, relying solely on this intuition to preset reasoning structures might not always be accurate.\\nAs shown in Figure 2, Case A initially appears to be a highly complex problem due to its 18 premises. However, upon prioritizing the premises, we review that the problem\\u2019s reasoning could be modeled using a concise chain-like reasoning structure with only two steps. This indicates the reasoning structure should not be preset before reasoning but rather formed through review after problem solving. Case B presents only 4 premises, but each premise is complicated and requires to be repeatedly utilized to reach the conclusion. This also indicates that determining a problem\\u2019s diffculty solely based on the complexity of its context might not always be accurate. More reasoning examples and detailed reasoning processes are available in Appendix.\\nImpact of the number of determinate premises. In practice, the required number of generated determinate premises (denoted as $n$ ) is a key hyperparameter for our method. To weigh the reasoning effectiveness and effciency, a larger number may not always be better. As shown in Figure 3, generating more determinate premises will gradually streamline the reasoning process. The reasoning performance of smaller $n$ is comparable to some baselines, and as $n$ increases, our method can achieve the best performance. However, the subsequent increase in $n$ will bring about a signifcant increase in the number of reasoning iterations, while the improvement in accuracy will be very limited. Therefore, we set $n$ to 4 in our experiment, a position close to the infection point to trade off effect improvement and effciency control.\\nGeneration effciency of determinate premises. we further investigate the odds of success and failure across multiple reasoning iterations. Therefore, we make a more detailed analysis of the average number of reasoning steps required to generate a useful proposition. As shown in Table 3, DetermLR outperforms the baseline signifcantly across all datasets by using the fewest steps to generate each useful new insight. This number could also refect the average diffculty of the datasets to some extent. For LogiQA, both CR (4.25) and DetermLR (2.63) are much higher than the values on other datasets, which indicates that the analytical reasoning questions in LogiQA are still the most challenging tasks. To validate this hypothesis, we obtain human performance on LogiQA by inviting two volunteers\\u2014 one, a graduate student with experience in public examinations, completed all questions with an accuracy rate of 73, and the other, a student with no prior exposure to such knowledge, achieved an accuracy rate of 59.\\n\\nComplexity analysis. We also conduct a complexity analysis for more detailed effciency comparisons. We choose ToT and CR as strong multistep reasoning baselines to compute the average inference time for each reasoning step. All experiments in this analysis are performed on the same device for fair comparison. The results in Table 4 show that although the inference time per step for DetermLR is slightly more than CR and ToT, the superiority of DetermLR lies in substantially saving overall required reasoning steps. Therefore, considering the inference time per case, we can see that the overall inference effciency of DetermLR\\nError analysis.

To verify the capability of LLMs to engage in rigorous logical reasoning based solely on established conditions, without external knowledge, we carefully select fve challenging logical reasoning benchmarks: (1) LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020) collects the multiple-choice logical problems from National Civil Servants Examination of China. Since it contains different types of questions, we carefully reviewed its test set and retained 179 high-quality questions whose premises are delineated within the context as a curated collection. (2) ProofWriter (Tafjord et al., 2020) is a widely used logical reasoning benchmark. We use the open-world assumption subset where each case requires to be proven true, false or unknown. We follow Pan et al. (2023) to use the depth-5 subset containing 600 cases for evaluation. (3) FOLIO (Han et al., 2022) is a challenging benchmark requiring complex frst-order logic reasoning to solve. We follow the offcial data split and choose the validation set containing 204 examples for evaluation. (4) PrOntoQA (Saparov and He, 2022) is similar to ProofWriter for evaluating logical reasoning. (5) LogicalDeduction (LD) is a challenging task in BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022). The problems are mainly about deducing the order of objects from a set of conditions.
