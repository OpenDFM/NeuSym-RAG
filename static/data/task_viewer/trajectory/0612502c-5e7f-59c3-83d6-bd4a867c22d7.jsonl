{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Since the bias infuences the output from the LLMs across various tasks, the widespread deployment of the LLMs is hampered. We propose a simple method that utilizes structured knowledge to alleviate this issue, aiming to reduce the bias embedded within the LLMs and ensuring they have an encompassing perspective when used in applications. Experimental results indicated that our method has good debiasing ability when applied to existing both autoregressive and masked language models. Additionally, it could ensure that the performances of LLMs on downstream tasks remain uncompromised. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in the debiasing ability. Importantly, our method obviates the need for training from scratch, thus offering enhanced scalability and costeffectiveness.1\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"There have recently been rapid developments in natural language processing (NLP) with the emergence of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs). Fine-tuning these models can signifcantly improve their performance in downstream tasks because, during the fne-tuning process, the knowledge acquired during pre-training on large corpora can be awakened and effectively applied to the downstream tasks. However, biases present in LLMs (e.g., gender and occupation biases) can be a serious problem because of being propagated to the downstream tasks. Therefore, their analysis and mitigation in LLMs have become a critical issue.\\nAnalysis of the text generated by LLMs has shown that the bias exists at the word-level (Sheng\\nTable 1: Regard scores (Sheng et al., 2019) of generated texts from contexts, containing \\u201claborer\\u201d or \\u201cCEO\\u201d. We used GPT2-large to generate the texts. The detail of the score is described in Sec. 4.5.\\net al., 2019; Nozza et al., 2021). The frst phenomenon entails that when given a context, LLMs prefer generating words of a certain category with a higher probability. For example, when the input context is \\u201cThe CEO believes that\\u201d, the distribution of output probabilities shows a higher likelihood of the next word being \\u201che\\u201d rather than \\u201cshe\\u201d. However, if the word \\u201cCEO\\u201d in the context is replaced with \\u201cnurse\\u201d, the bias leads to a higher probability of generating \\u201cshe\\u201d over \\u201che\\u201d (Hewitt et al., 2023). The second phenomenon is that when generating text related to a particular noun, LLMs tend to prefer generating content with a specifc attribute. For example, as observed in our experiments (see Table 1), when LLMs generate text related to \\u201claborer\\u201d and \\u201cCEO\\u201d separately, the text related to \\u201claborer\\u201d exhibits a neutral sentiment, whereas the text related to \\u201cCEO\\u201d possesses a higher positive sentiment.\\nIt is commonly believed that these biases are caused by the biases inherent in the pre-training data (Brunet et al., 2019; Dev et al., 2020; Papakyriakopoulos et al., 2020). We assume the heightened association between \\u201cCEO\\u201d and the positive sentiment is attributed to the co-occurrence of \\u201cCEO\\u201d with many positive connotations. Consequently, LLMs incorporate positive features into the representation of \\u201cCEO\\u201d. During the inference process, LLMs tend to reproduce and magnify the bias inherent in the pre-training data (Kurita et al., 2019; Sheng et al., 2019), which causes a rise in the probability of generating positive content, resulting in the production of biased text.\\n\\nPrevious research has sought to alleviate the bias by controlling the pre-training data (Touvron et al., 2023a) or by adjusting embeddings (Hewitt et al., 2023). However, these approaches require models to be pre-trained from scratch, which signifcantly increases the training cost. To address this issue, we propose a simple method characterized by diminished computation cost. It mitigates the inherent bias in LLMs by incorporating structured knowledge during a second phase of pre-training. The structured knowledge contains hypernyms for a word as one of the relationships between words. Since the hypernyms tend to cover broader or more general concepts, even when a word causes a bias for surrounding words, the second pre-training by incorporating the information of its hypernyms can enhance its representation to take into account the hypernyms, thus decreasing the bias caused by the word. For example, from the knowledge piece \\u201cCEO is-a employee\\u201d, we can construct a sentence \\u201ca CEO is an employee.\\u201d, which signifes that a \\u201cCEO\\u201d belongs to the superordinate concept of \\u201cemployee\\u201d. By training with these sentences for the hypernym information, we can incorporate the representation for \\u201cemployee\\u201d into that for \\u201cCEO\\u201d, that makes LLMs generate content more related to \\u201cemployee\\u201d and reduce the focus on positive content related to \\u201cCEO\\u201d, achieving the goal of debiasing. Since our method is implemented only with a second phase of pre-training and needs no pre-training from scratch, it reduces the cost of training compared to the previous methods.\\nOur experiments demonstrated the effcacy of our method in debiasing across various LLMs while preserving their generalization ability. Specifcally, our results for autoregressive and masked language models indicated that our method can lower bias. Concurrently, models with our method did not exhibit signifcant performance degradation in downstream tasks, affrming the preservation of their generalization ability. Furthermore, comparing to strong debiasing baselines, our method yielded superior scores and exhibited enhanced bias control.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"While the majority of tasks have been accomplished using the LLMs (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford and Wu, 2019; Touvron et al., 2023a,b) with the advancement of LLMs, an increasing number of researchers have discovered bias embedded within them. Several previous studies have demonstrated the presence of the bias in word embeddings (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Brunet et al., 2019; Papakyriakopoulos et al., 2020). When applying the LLMs to downstream tasks, such as automatic summarization or web search, the bias can lead to signifcant harm. Jentzsch and Turan (2022) and Kirk et al. (2021) identifed obverse gender bias in BERT and GPT2, where their prediction often reinforces gender-based stereotypes, e.g., doctors are assumed to be male and nurses to be female. Standard benchmarks utilized to evaluate the bias consist of various kinds of stereotypical and antistereotypical sentence pairs. CrowSPairs (Nangia et al., 2020) is a commonly used dataset to measure whether a model generally prefers stereotypical sentences.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Researchers have proposed various methods to mitigate the bias in NLP models. Park et al. (2018); Zhao et al. (2019); Garg et al. (2019); Touvron et al. (2023a) mitigated the bias by changing the pre-training data or the underlying word embeddings, and then by retraining the model. Bordia and Bowman (2019) mitigated the bias in a word level and also required the retraining. The Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) method, proposed by Zimmermann and Hoffmann (2022), and the Data Interventions (DI) method, proposed by Thakur et al. (2023), both used designed examples to mitigate bias in the models. Liang et al. (2020) proposed the SENT-DEBIAS method, which captures the bias subspace of sentence representations by using templates. However, all these methods still suffer from high training cost or unsatisfactory bias control.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"As shown in Figure 1, we propose the utilization of structured knowledge to mitigate the bias within LLMs. Our method consists of two main steps: frst acquiring textual data for second pre-training from the structured knowledge, and then pre-training the pre-trained LLM using the acquired data, before fne-tuning it for specifc downstream tasks.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Previous research (Brunet et al., 2019; Dev et al., 2020; Shaikh et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023a,b) has suggested that the types of bias in LLMs are linked to human-related attributes such as gender, occupation, religion, and so on. Hence, in our method, we utilize structured knowledge related to humans for debiasing.\\nWe frst collect human-related nouns, such as \\u201cCEO\\u201d and \\u201cartist\\u201d. Then, we obtain a set of structured knowledge pieces for humans, where a structured knowledge piece is between two nouns within the \\u2018is-a\\u2019 relation, by utilizing the collected nouns; for example, \\u201chuman-related noun is-a X\\u201d and \\u201cY is-a human-related noun\\u201d, where X and Y are a hypernym and hyponym of the noun, respectively. Since we cannot incorporate the acquired structured knowledge directly into LLMs, to use the structured knowledge in LLMs, by adhering to human grammatical convention, we transform it into sentences, such that \\u201ca human-related noun is a X\\u201d. This sentence construction method has been commonly used in previous work (Bosselut et al., 2019; Guan et al., 2020).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Next, we pre-train the pre-trained LLMs on these acquired textual data to incorporate the structured knowledge into the LLMs. We have contemplated the following two aspects:\\n1.
