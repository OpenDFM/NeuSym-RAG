{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

However, many challenges remain, including collecting diverse and representative datasets for the target behaviors, preventing hallucination, and mitigating out-of-distribution failures. Moreover, the way in which these methods work is often opaque.\\nThe set of alignment techniques known as \\u201cactivation engineering\\u201d or \\u201crepresentation engineering\\u201d work by making targeted perturbations to a model\\u2019s activations (Subramani et al., 2022; Hernandez et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023). Although activation engineering techniques have shown some promise as a way to steer models\\u2019 behavior, their mechanisms, properties, and effects have yet to be robustly verifed across different models and types of behaviors.\\nWe employ Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) to modulate high-level alignment-relevant behaviors in LLMs and study its effects and properties in various test scenarios. We apply the technique to Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fnetuned LLMs ranging in scale from 7 to 70 billion parameters (Touvron et al., 2023), primarily focusing on Llama 2 Chat, which is optimized for dialogue use-cases and fnetuned using RLHF for safety. This enables us to study the interaction between RLHF\\/fnetuning techniques and activation engineering, building on top of the existing body of research on pretrained models and demonstrating that CAA can be used on top of fnetuning techniques to improve alignment-relevant properties.\\nSection 3 describes the process of generating steering vectors, including the datasets we used to construct them. Section 4 presents our main results on the effects of CAA on multiple-choice and open-ended generation evaluations. In particular, across all of the seven categories we tested, the addition\\/subtraction of the steering vectors increased\\/decreased the prevalence of the behavior, as rated by GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). We then show CAA\\u2019s effects on transfer, compare it to other alignment techniques such as system-prompting and fnetuning, and investigate the geometrical relationships of the steering vectors. Section 9 concludes by discussing our results qualitatively and pointing towards potential future research directions.\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Turner et al. (2023)\\u2019s Activation Addition approach generates steering vectors by taking the difference in intermediate activations of a pair of prompts at a particular layer and token position in a transformer model. The steering vector is then added to the frst token position of other forward passes to steer the model\\u2019s completions. This technique has limitations; it does not consistently work for different behaviors, is not robust to different prompts, and was only tested on GPT-2-XL (Radford et al., 2019). Our technique is similar to Activation Addition. However, our steering vectors are generated from a dataset of contrast pairs rather than a single pair. Using hundreds of diverse contrast pairs reduces noise in the steering vector, allowing for a more precise encoding of the behavior of interest. We also add our steering vector to all and only token positions after the original prompt.\\nLi et al. (2023) employ linear probes to predict truthfulness on a contrastive question-answering dataset to identify as sparse sets of \\u201ctruthful\\u201d attention heads. During inference, they shift activations along the vector connecting the means of the true and false distributions, employing the same Mean Difference vector extraction approach as CAA. This technique improves truthfulness on adversarial benchmarks while minimally impacting fuency and requiring little data compared to alternatives. We similarly aim to modulate properties of the output via linear perturbations. However, our technique can be applied directly to the residual stream without searching for individual attention heads, and we validate the approach on a broader range of alignment-relevant behaviors in models trained using RLHF.\\nZou et al. (2023) propose various techniques for locating and extracting representations corresponding to high-level concepts such as honesty and emotions in LLMs. They also test the Mean Difference approach used in CAA for representation extractions. However, CAA employs an optimized multiple-choice format that results in more closely paired contrastive prompts that differ by only a single token. We also build on this work by focusing on steering rather than representation extraction, experimenting with a broader range of behaviors, and comparing steering to system-prompting and supervised fnetuning.\\n\\nLiu et al. (2023) steer models to reduce toxicity and affect style transfer. Unlike CAA, they steer the attention activations rather than the residual stream and intervene at all transformer layers rather than a single layer.\\nBeyond steering behaviors, work on activation engineering has also motivated a formalization of \\u201clinear representation\\u201d (Park et al., 2023) and helped verify linear representations of sentiment in LLMs (Tigges et al., 2023).\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"The key idea behind CAA is to generate a steering vector that can shift a language model\\u2019s output distribution towards a desired behavior during inference. We create these steering vectors using pairs of prompts: one prompt demonstrating the desired behavior and one prompt demonstrating the opposite. By taking the average difference between the language model\\u2019s activations on a set of paired prompts, we isolate the direction in the model\\u2019s latent space corresponding to the target behavior.\\nSpecifcally, our prompt pairs consist of multiplechoice questions with answer letters (either \\u201cA\\u201d or \\u201cB\\u201d) appended at the end. The two prompts contain the same question but end with different answers; the \\\"positive\\\" prompt ends with the letter corresponding to the behavior in question, and the \\\"negative\\\" prompt ends with the letter corresponding to its opposite.\\nTo construct a steering vector, we compute the difference in the language model\\u2019s activations at the position of the answer letter between all the positive and negative prompts. This method of extracting the difference vector is called Mean Difference (MD) and has been shown to produce steering vectors similar to other techniques like PCA (Tigges et al., 2023). This process is shown in Figure 1.\\nFormally, given a dataset $\\\\mathcal{D}$ of (prompt p, positive completion $\\\\mathbf{c}_{p}$ , negative completion $\\\\mathbf{c}_{n}$ ) triples, we calculate the MD vector $v_{M D}$ for a layer $L$ as:\\nWhere ${\\\\bf a}_{L}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta})$ gives the activations at layer $L$ for the given prompt and completion letter.\\nIntuitively, by only varying the answer option between paired prompts and keeping the rest of the prompt constant, we isolate the internal representation most related to the target behavior while canceling out other confounding variables.\\nWe evaluate the effects of CAA on Llama 2 7B Chat and Llama 2 13B Chat, 7 and 13 billion parameter versions of Llama 2 that have been trained using RLHF for safety and to follow human instructions in a chat format. We also generate steering vectors from the Llama 2 7B base model to test similarity and transfer. To load the Llama 2 models, we employ the Huggingface Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2019).
