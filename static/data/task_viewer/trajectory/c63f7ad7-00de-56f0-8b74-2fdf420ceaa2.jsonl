{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

For\\ninstance, GPT-4 erroneously identifies 54.9% of feasible tasks as impossible. This issue primarily\\nstems from the UA hint in the instruction, while this hint allows models to identify unachievable\\ntasks, it also hinders performance on achievable tasks. To address this, we conduct an ablation study\\nwhere we remove this hint. We then break down the success rate for both achievable and unachievable\\ntasks. As shown in Table 2, eliminating this instruction led to a performance boost in achievable\\ntasks, enhancing the overall task success rate of GPT-4 to 14.41%. Despite an overall decline in\\nidentifying unachievable tasks, GPT-4 retains the capacity to recognize 44.44% of such tasks. It does\\nso by generating reasons of non-achievability, even without explicit instructions. On the other hand,\\nGPT-3.5 rarely exhibits this level of reasoning. Instead, it tends to follow problematic patterns such\\nas hallucinating incorrect answers, repeating invalid actions, or exceeding the step limits. This result\\nsuggests that even subtle differences in instruction design can significantly influence the behavior of\\na model in performing interactive tasks in complex environments.\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nSuccess rate (%) within a template\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n# T\\nemplate\\ngpt-3.5-direct\\ngpt-3.5-cot\\ngpt-4-cot\\nTable 3: Distribution of suc-\\ncess rates on templates with\\n\\u22651 successful executions on\\nGPT models (no UA hint).\\nCan a model maintain consistent performance across similar\\ntasks?\\nTasks that originate from the same template usually follow\\nsimilar reasoning and planning processes, even though their observa-\\ntions and executions will differ.

Of the 61 templates, GPT-4\\nmanages to achieve a 100% task success rate on only four templates,\\nwhile GPT-3.5 fails to achieve full task completion for any of the\\ntemplates.

Nonetheless,\\nto fully leverage the power of autonomous agents, it is crucial to understand their behavior within an\\nenvironment that is both authentic and reproducible. This will allow measurement of the ability of\\nagents on tasks that human users care about in a fair and consistent manner.\\nCurrent environments for evaluate agents tend to over-simplify real-world situations. As a result, the\\nfunctionality of many environments is a limited version of their real-world counterparts, leading to\\na lack of task diversity (Shi et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2018; Misra et al.,\\n2016; Shridhar et al., 2020; 2021; Yao et al., 2022a). In addition, these simplifications often lower\\nthe complexity of tasks as compared to their execution in the real world (Puig et al., 2018; Shridhar\\net al., 2020; Yao et al., 2022a). Finally, some environments are presented as a static resource (Shi\\net al., 2017; Deng et al., 2023) where agents are confined to accessing only those states that were\\npreviously cached during data collection, thus limiting the breadth and diversity of exploration.\\nFor evaluation, many environments focus on comparing the textual surface form of the predicted\\n\\u2217Lead contributors.\\n\\u2020Equal contribution.\\n1\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\\nTell me how much I spent on \\nfood purchase in March 2023\\n15\\nWebArena Environment\\n\\u201d\\n\\u201d\\n\\u201c\\n\\u201c Create a \\u2018NolanFans' repo, \\nlisting Nolan's Oscar-winning \\n\\ufb01lms in a README \\ufb01le\\nAction\\nFeedback\\nAI Agent\\nTool Sites\\nKnowledge resources\\nWeb applications from popular domains\\ncheck_repo \\ncheck_readme \\ncheck_answer\\nFunctional \\nSuccess\\nFunctional \\nFailure\\nFigure 1: WebArena is a standalone, self-hostable web environment for building autonomous agents.\\nWebArena creates websites from four popular categories with functionality and data mimicking\\ntheir real-world equivalents. To emulate human problem-solving, WebArena also embeds tools and\\nknowledge resources as independent websites. WebArena introduces a benchmark on interpreting\\nhigh-level realistic natural language command to concrete web-based interactions. We provide\\nvalidators to programmatically validate the functional correctness of each task.\\naction sequences with reference action sequences, disregarding the functional correctness of the\\nexecutions and possible alternative solutions (Puig et al., 2018; Jernite et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2021; Li\\net al., 2020; Deng et al., 2023). These limitations often result in a discrepancy between simulated\\nenvironments and the real world, and can potentially impact the generalizability of AI agents to\\nsuccessfully understand, adapt, and operate within complex real-world situations.\\nWe introduce WebArena, a realistic and reproducible web environment designed to facilitate the\\ndevelopment of autonomous agents capable of executing tasks (\\u00a72). An overview of WebArena\\nis in Figure 1. Our environment comprises four fully operational, self-hosted web applications,\\neach representing a distinct domain prevalent on the internet: online shopping, discussion forums,\\ncollaborative development, and business content management. Furthermore, WebArena incorporates\\nseveral utility tools, such as map, calculator, and scratchpad, to best support possible human-like task\\nexecutions. Lastly, WebArena is complemented by an extensive collection of documentation and\\nknowledge bases that vary from general resources like English Wikipedia to more domain-specific\\nreferences, such as manuals for using the integrated development tool (Fan et al., 2022). The content\\npopulating these websites is extracted from their real-world counterparts, preserving the authenticity\\nof the content served on each platform. We deliver the hosting services using Docker containers with\\ngym-APIs (Brockman et al., 2016), ensuring both the usability and the reproducibility of WebArena.\\nAlong with WebArena, we release a ready-to-use benchmark with 812 long-horizon web-based\\ntasks (\\u00a73). Each task is described as a high-level natural language intent, emulating the abstract\\nlanguage usage patterns typically employed by humans (Bisk et al., 2019). Two example intents\\nare shown in the upper left of Figure 1. We focus on evaluating the functional correctness of these\\ntasks, i.e., does the result of the execution actually achieve the desired goal (\\u00a73.2). For instance,\\nto evaluate the example in Figure 2, our evaluation method verifies the concrete contents in the\\ndesignated repository. This evaluation is not only more reliable (Zhong et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2021;\\nWang et al., 2022) than comparing the textual surface-form action sequences (Puig et al., 2018; Deng\\net al., 2023) but also accommodate a range of potential valid paths to achieve the same goal, which is\\na ubiquitous phenomenon in sufficiently complex tasks.\\nWe use this benchmark to evaluate several agents that can follow NL command and perform web-\\nbased tasks (\\u00a74). These agents are implemented in a few-shot in-context learning fashion with\\npowerful large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and PALM-2. Experiment results show that\\nthe best GPT-4 agent performance is somewhat limited, with an end-to-end task success rate of only\\n14.41%, while the human performance is 78.24%. We hypothesize that the limited performance of\\ncurrent LLMs stems from a lack of crucial capabilities such as active exploration and failure recovery\\nto successfully perform complex tasks (\\u00a75.1). These outcomes underscore the necessity for further\\ndevelopment towards robust and effective agents (LeCun, 2022) in WebArena.\\n2\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
