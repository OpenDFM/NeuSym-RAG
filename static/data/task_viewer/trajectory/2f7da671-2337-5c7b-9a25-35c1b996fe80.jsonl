{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Each subject includes at least 100 multiple-choice questions with 4 answer choices. The entire benchmark contains 14,042 questions (Tables A.29 and A.30 have a breakdown of the MMLU subjects and their distributions).\\nAi2 Reasoning Challenge (Clark et al., 2018b) is a benchmark consisting of 7787 grade school science questions. The benchmark is split into two sets: Easy and Challenge. We conduct experiments on the Challenge set (ARC-C) which is proven to contain harder questions for existing models. The questions in ARC-C have 3-5 answer choices.\\nUnless otherwise stated, the reported score for each experiment\\/model combination on MMLU is the mean accuracy across all 14,042 questions. All tested model tokenizers encode the multiple-choice answers as single tokens. Hence, the accuracy is equivalent to the normalized accuracy. All baseline and modifed MMLU benchmarks were performed using the LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2023) library. Their implementation of MMLU measures the log-likelihood of each of the answer tokens $l^{\\\\,\\\\prime}A^{\\\\,\\\\prime}$ , $'B\\\",\\\"C\\\",\\\"D\\\"J$ after the input prompt and chooses the letter with the highest probability as the model\\u2019s answer.\\n\\nSome of our experiments require permuting the answer choice order (Table 1, A.8, A.9, and A.10), however, this can be confusing for questions where the answer choices are dependent on their position, such as \\u201cD. All of the above.\\u201d, or reference other choices, such as \\u201cC. Both A and B.\\u201d. To circumvent this dependency, we manually inspected and modifed the questions from three subjects to ensure their answers are permutation-independent for a subset of our experiments. The modifed subjects are college chemistry, college mathematics, and global facts.\\nFor each variation introduced to the MCQ benchmarks, we calculate the change in accuracy (\\u2206Acc) and recall standard deviation (RStd) for each model. RStd measures the bias of a model to a particular answer choice by computing the standard deviation of recalls for each answer choice (Zheng et al., 2023). This metric quantifes how much the model favors particular positions for the correct answer choice. We typically observe whether RStd changes (\\u2206RStd) are signifcant across experimental settings.\\nTo measure the change in ranking induced by an applied perturbation to a benchmark, we measure the normalized Kendall\\u2019s $\\\\tau$ distance between two rankings of $n$ models (Kendall, 1938). Kendall\\u2019s $\\\\tau$ computes the number of swapped pairs between two rankings normalized by the total number of pairs $\\\\textstyle{\\\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}$ . We report $\\\\begin{array}{r}{k_{\\\\tau}=\\\\frac{\\\\tau+1}{2}}\\\\end{array}$ , where $k_{\\\\tau}=1.0$ indicates total agreement between rankings, and $k_{\\\\tau}=0$ indicates complete disagreement by reversing the original rankings.\"}\n{\"score\":7.7052,\"pdf_id\":\"5fe57755-14f1-5ee7-a4b4-ecaba6827045\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"bea43df8-535d-598f-a123-e576f0327829\",\"text\":\"Table A.5: The average zero-shot results on the three selected domains baseline using the Hybrid style mentioned in section 3.2.

This proves that if we provide choices in the prompt, models will perform better.\\nTable A.16: The zero-shot results of ARC-C using the Hybrid style discussed in 3.2. In some models, it exhibits higher accuracy than the baseline (Table A.2) and more stable RStd values (compared to A.15). The deltas are calculated using this table A.2.\\nTable A.17: Trivial examples few-shot results using the version 1 examples with respect to zero-shot baseline accuracy.\\nTable A.20: Zero-shot results of removing the subject name from the prompt. (experiment 1 from fgure 10). There are minimal changes in performance when applying this perturbation.\\nTable A.21: Zero-shot results on adding the \\u201cCorrect\\\" token in the prompt. (experiment 2 from fgure 10). There are minimal changes in performance when applying this perturbation.\\nTable A.22: Few-shot results of removing the subject name from the prompt. (experiment 1 from fgure 10). There are minimal changes in performance when applying this perturbation.\\nTable A.23: Few-shot results on adding the \\u201cCorrect\\\" token in the prompt. (experiment 2 from fgure 10). There are minimal changes in performance when applying this perturbation.\\nTable A.24: Subject independent fve-shots example results with the frst prompt. (follow Figure 9 for details). With few exceptions, most models exhibit a $2\\\\%$ drop from changing the few shots example domains. For models that are not fne-tuned, we noticed a performance that is halfway between the standard zero-shot and fve-shot. Indicating that these models utilize the few shots for both formatting and knowledge domain information.\\nTable A.25: Subject independent fve-shot example results with the second prompt. (follow fgure 9 for details). Changes in the initial prompt only result in negligible differences when compared to the frst prompt in Table A.24.\\nTable A.27: Results of the one-shot and fve-shot MMLU in-context cheating experiment. Performance expectedly increases, indicating that models are readily able to \\\"cheat\\\" from the given few-shot examples in both fve-shot and one-shot cases. However, no model achieved $100\\\\%$ accuracy, so we encourage the investigation of misclassifed samples to validate their correctness.\\nTable A.30: The MMLU subjects statistics in the dev split, which is a fxed set of questions per subject used in fewshots evaluation.\"}\n{\"score\":6.7567,\"pdf_id\":\"5fe57755-14f1-5ee7-a4b4-ecaba6827045\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"41d6100e-b04a-54c3-9d07-53d691e0aeb8\",\"text\":\"Table A.1: The baseline accuracies and RStd values for the original MMLU implementation which uses the Symbols scoring style mentioned in section 3.2.

Depending on the ability that is being assessed (e.g., language generation, knowledge understanding, complex reasoning) some benchmarks are designed in the form of close-ended problems like MCQs. To facilitate comparisons among LLMs, a number of leaderboards aggregating these benchmarks have been established, such as the OpenLLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023) and OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023).\\nHowever, issues with the leaderboards and the underlying benchmarks have emerged. In a case study, Deng et al. (2023) discovered contamination\\/leakage of the MMLU benchmark in the training sets of multiple models. A signifcant portion of models memorized benchmark questions and was able to perfectly reconstruct the removed part of some benchmark questions or answers. For instance, GPT-4 correctly completed the questions in $29\\\\%$ of the prompts with URL hinting.\\nEven under the assumption of uncontaminated data, the performance of models on the underlying benchmarks are not robust to minor perturbations. Pezeshkpour and Hruschka (2023) showed that specifc orderings of MMLU answer choices resulted in up to $\\\\pm30\\\\%$ deviations in GPT-4 performance on various subjects. Similarly, Zheng et al. (2023) demonstrate that models are biased to certain answer letters. On llama-30B, they showed a $27\\\\%$ difference in MMLU accuracy by forcing all correct answers to either position A or D. As well, (Robinson et al., 2023) fnd that the accuracy of LLMs improve (without regard to bias) when evaluating using a pure multiple choice question style vs a cloze question answering style.\\nWhile prior work has highlighted weaknesses in LLMs themselves (Zheng et al., 2023; Pezeshkpour and Hruschka, 2023), evaluation method (Robinson et al., 2023), or the contents of benchmarks (Dehghani et al., 2021) in our work we thoroughly study the effects these factors have on existing leaderboards and demonstrate where leaderboards lack robustness.\"}\n{\"score\":5.92,\"pdf_id\":\"5fe57755-14f1-5ee7-a4b4-ecaba6827045\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"7002dc7a-54fe-592c-b378-af23ea6e9562\",\"text\":\"In this category, we attempt to measure model and benchmark robustness in the few-shot setting by testing the entire spectrum of knowledge injected in the few-shot examples.

This corresponds to the simplest setting for the model, where it only needs to look up the answer in the context.\\nIncorrect answer provided This setting is the opposite of the former. The target question is provided with an incorrect answer as an example. It is challenging as the model must ignore the context and determine the correct answer independently.\\nTrivial examples We replace few-shot examples with simple questions the model is known to be able to answer (typically related to the language\\/text of the question itself). The only information the examples convey is related to formatting (Soltan et al., 2022). We create three versions of these questions and answers using GPT-4 and ensure the model can answer them correctly (as shown in Figure 8).\\nOut of domain examples Instead of providing examples from the same subject as the target question, we add out-of-domain questions (from another subject) as the few-shot examples.
