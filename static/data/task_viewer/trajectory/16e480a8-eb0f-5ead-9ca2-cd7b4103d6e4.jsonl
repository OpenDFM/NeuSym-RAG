{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

These representations can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as semantic textual similarity (Agirre et al., 2016; Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), information retrieval (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Long et al., 2022a), text classifcation (Garg et al., 2020), etc. Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have recently become the dominant approach for text representation. However, text representation models developed on large PLMs typically require enormous computational resources and storage that prevent widespread deployment. Further, direct training on small-scale PLMs will lead to a signifcant decrease in model performance (Zhao et al., 2022).\\n\\nKnowledge distillation (KD) is a commonly used approach to reduce the performance gap between large and small models (Hinton et al., 2015). This method entails training a large-scale model, referred to as the \\u201cteacher\\u201d model, followed by transferring its knowledge to a smaller \\u201cstudent\\u201d model. The conventional distillation methods mainly concentrate on classifcation tasks, endeavoring to make the probability distribution of the student model\\u2019s output as similar as possible to that of the teacher model. Recently, various distillation methods have been proposed for representation models (Tian et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022). The primary objective of these methods is to ensure that the student model\\u2019s representation closely resembles that of the teacher model. This is typically achieved through the use of a learning objective such as mean squared error (MSE) or contrastive learning loss.\\nFor an input text $X$ , the fnal representations of the teacher model and student model are denoted as $T$ and $S$ , respectively. From an information theory perspective, the conventional distillation learning process of continuously approximating $T$ and $S$ through optimization objectives such as MSE or contrastive learning can be regarded as maximizing the mutual information (MI) between $T$ and $S$ , which is denoted as $I(T,S)$ . However, according to the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle (Tishby and Zaslavsky, 2015), simply maximizing $I(T,S)$ is prone to over-ftting. According to the IB principle, when given an input $X$ and its corresponding label $Y$ , our goal is to learn a lowdimensional representation $Z$ that is informative for predicting $Y$ while minimizing the presence of irrelevant information. The IB method represents this information compressing process as maximizing the mutual information between $Z$ and $Y$ while minimizing the mutual information between $Z$ and $X$ . This approach ensures that the most useful information is preserved, while redundant information is discarded. In text representation distillation, the representations of the teacher and student models, $T$ and $S$ , can be equivalently considered as the label $Y$ and the compressed representation $Z$ .\\n\\nTherefore, we propose a new text representation distillation method based on the IB principle, called IBKD. It aims to maximize the mutual information between $S$ and $T$ while minimizing the mutual information between $S$ and $X$ . As shown in Figure 1, compared to the conventional distillation methods (left), IBKD can effectively flters out task-irrelevant information and retains only the task-relevant information (right), thus improving the generalization of the student model\\u2019s representation. Further, to address the issue of excessive computational effort in directly calculating mutual information (Alemi et al., 2017a), we introduce different methods to approximate the upper and lower bounds of mutual information. Specifcally, we use contrastive learning loss (Sordoni et al., 2021) to estimate the lower bound of mutual information and the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2005) is used to estimate the upper bound.\\nMoreover, we found that two-stage distillation can signifcantly improve the performance of the student model. Concretely, the frst stage distillation based on large-scale unsupervised data allows the student model to acquire basic text representation characteristics, while the second stage of distillation based on supervised data can further strengthen the representation ability of the student model. Importantly, both two stages of distillation can be effciently performed within the same framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct experiments on two main downstream tasks of text representation: the semantic textual similarity (STS) task and the dense retrieval (DR) task. Our experimental results have shown that our approach signifcantly outperforms other methods.\\n\\nBriefy, our main contributions are as follows: 1) Drawing on the IB principle, we propose a new IBKD method for text representation distillation. 2) We introduce the Contrastive learning loss and HSIC method to reduce the computational cost of mutual information. 3) We verify the effectiveness of IBKD on multiple benchmark datasets for two different down-streaming tasks.\"}\n{\"score\":17.326,\"pdf_id\":\"0d99c5cf-d5f7-5fa6-9559-f88731d5fff1\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"89240e41-4f8c-577e-8634-371cb1072ffd\",\"text\":\"To fully utilize both unsupervised and supervised data, the training process of the student model consists of two stages, as outlined in prior research (Wu et al., 2021). In the frst stage, referred to as the distillation stage, we utilize a substantial amount of unlabeled data to train the student model with the following loss function:\\nthe centering matrix is denoted as $\\\\begin{array}{r}{H=I-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\mathbf{1}\\\\mathbf{1}^{T}}\\\\end{array}$ , where $t r$ represents the trace of a matrix. $K_{X}$ and $K_{S}$ are kernel Gram matrices (Ham et al., 2004) of $X$ and $S$ respectively, where $K_{X_{i j}}=k(x_{i},x_{j})$ and $k(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot)$ denotes a kernel function. In this paper, we use the commonly used radial basis function (RBF) kernel (Vert et al., 2004) by experiments\\nwhere $\\\\gamma$ is a hyperparameter. It is worth highlighting that the above equation relies solely on positively paired samples to construct the kernel matrices $K_{X}$ and $K_{Y}$ , which means that the calculation process is notably more effcient than directly estimating mutual information.\\nAlthough it is feasible to replace the InfoNCE loss with HSIC to maximize $I(S,T)$ , previous research (Tschannen et al., 2020) has demonstrated that using the InfoNCE loss often leads to better\\nduring this stage of training, the student model can acquire the text representation characteristics of the teacher model, effectively imbuing the former with the latter\\u2019s features.\\nIn the second stage, known as the fne-tuning stage, we subject the student model to further fnetuning using labeled data. This process helps to mitigate any potential bias introduced by the use of unlabeled data in the previous stage. Importantly, the labeled data used in this stage can be identical to that which was used to train the teacher model.\\nConsidering a labeled dataset consisting of multiple instances, where each instance contains an anchor sample $x_{i}$ , a positive sample $x_{i}^{+}$ , and a set of $K$ negative samples: $\\\\{x_{i1}^{-},x_{i2}^{-},\\\\ldots,x_{i k}^{-}\\\\}$ .
