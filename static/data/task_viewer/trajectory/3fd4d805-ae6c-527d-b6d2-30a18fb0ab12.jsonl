{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The results are shown in Figure 3, where the columns and rows correspond to the source domain and target domain respectively. For the zero-shot study, no demonstrations are given (rightest column in Figure 3). We empirically fnd that given no reasoning demonstrations, GRAPH-COT cannot work in all the datasets (nearly 0 performance). This implies that the LLMs suffer if given insuffcient instructions (only graph defnition and interaction function defnitions). For the crossdomain study, we provide demonstrations from the source domain graphs and test on the target domain graphs. From the result (left fve columns in Figure 3), in-domain demonstrations (diagonal) perform quite well and GRAPH-COT is overall robust to demonstration domain-shift. This observation underscores the adaptability and effectiveness of GRAPH-COT in capturing the key steps of graph chain-reasoning through in-context learning, despite the diverse demonstration domains.\\n\\nHow Different LLMs Perform in GRAPH-COT?

However, LLMs suffer from hallucination problems and sometimes tend to generate content that appears plausible but is ungrounded (Tonmoy et al., 2024). This is because they memorize world knowledge parametrically and fail to refer to concrete knowledge sources (Zhang et al.,\\n2023b). To alleviate the hallucination issues, existing works propose to augment LLMs with external text corpora as knowledge sources (Shuster et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2023) and treat every single document as a knowledge unit. Retrieval augmentation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2023) is then proposed to enable LLMs to interact with external knowledge sources, where relevant texts are retrieved and serve as contexts to improve the factuality of LLMs (shown in Figure 1 (a)). However, retrieval augmentation assumes that knowledge is well represented in individual text units and ignores the correlations among multiple text units.\\nIn real-world scenarios, text units are generally interconnected, forming a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge of such graphs is refected not only in the form of texts but also in the structure of their connections. For example, academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citation links (Wang et al., 2020). We can trace the source of a research direction (Bai et al., 2019) by traversing such a graph. Cases and opinions in a legal graph are interconnected by reference edges (Sadeghian et al., 2018). We can verify the judgment for a case by looking up its citations on such a graph (Chen et al., 2019).\\nAlthough widely used for text corpora as external knowledge sources, retrieval-augmentation cannot be readily used to augment LLMs with graphs for two reasons: 1) Structure Context: Retrieval augmentation can fnd individual nodes\\/texts from the graphs which can serve as context to augment the LLMs. However, knowledge on the graph also lies in the structure which can not be captured by single nodes\\/texts. 2) Graph Size Explosion: Although it is feasible to convert local subgraph structures into text descriptions as the input contexts to LLMs, the size of the local subgraph increases exponentially as the hop number increases, resulting in an excessively long context sequence. This could cause LLMs to be lost in the middle (Liu\\nFigure 1: Augmenting LLMs with external text corpora or external text-attributed graph.\\net al., 2023) given a plethora of irrelevant information in the context. In addition, the long sequence could potentially exceed the input length limitations of LLMs (Zhao et al., 2023).\\nTherefore, it is an important research topic to augment LLMs with such graph information. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of benchmark datasets to support the development of methodology and facilitate the evaluation of the proposed models. To this end, we frst construct a Graph Reasoning benchmark dataset called GRBENCH. GRBENCH includes ten real-world graphs that can serve as external knowledge sources for LLMs from fve domains including academic, ecommerce, literature, healthcare, and legal domains. Each sample in GRBENCH consists of a manually designed question and an answer, which can be directly answered by referring to the graphs or retrieving the information from the graphs as context. To make the dataset comprehensive, we include samples of different diffculty levels: easy questions (which can be answered with single-hop reasoning on graphs), medium questions (which necessitate multi-hop reasoning on graphs), and hard questions (which call for inductive reasoning with information on graphs as context).\\nWe propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (GRAPH-COT). The main idea is to enable LLMs to traverse the graph step-by-step to fgure out the key information needed, rather than directly feeding the whole subgraph as context into the LLMs (shown in Figure 1 (b)). GRAPH-COT is an iterative framework, where one iteration corresponds to one step on the graph. Each iteration in GRAPH-COT consists of three sub-steps: 1) Reasoning: LLMs propose what conclusion we can make with the current information and what further information is needed from the graph; 2) Interaction: LLMs generate the interactions needed to fetch information from the graph (e.g., fnding the nodes, checking the neighbors, etc); 3) Execution: The requests from the interaction step are executed on the graph and the corresponding information is returned. In this way, LLMs can conduct chain-based reasoning on the graph and fnd the key information on the graph. This process will be iterated until LLMs conclude the fnal answer in the reasoning sub-step.\\n\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows: \\u2022 We propose the problem of augmenting LLMs with external graphs and introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset called GRBENCH. \\u2022 We develop a straightforward and effective framework GRAPH-COT to encourage the LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. \\u2022 We conduct extensive experiments on GRBENCH to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPH-COT and analyze its performance across different demonstration settings, backbone LLMs, and questions diffculties. Furthermore, we explore its failure cases with future directions outlined.\"}\n{\"score\":27.4768,\"pdf_id\":\"fb154467-1ce1-5c1f-9d4f-b4f5c76312ee\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"b3e1d123-103f-5a22-84ee-b84031591a36\",\"text\":\"Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts\\/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBENCH, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (GRAPH-COT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each GRAPH-COT iteration consists of three substeps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution.
