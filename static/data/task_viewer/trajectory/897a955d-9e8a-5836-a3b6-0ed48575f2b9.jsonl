{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

While this is commonly achieved by learning $n$ tasks under a joint optimization procedure, some methods, such as AdapterFusion, divide the problem into two stages: (i) task learning, where knowledge specifc to a task is encapsulated within sets of parameters (e.g., adapters), and (ii) transfer, where this already learned knowledge is leveraged for a target task. This separation of concerns provides numerous benefts (e.g., promoting reusability). However, current twostage MTL introduces a substantial number of additional parameters. We address this issue by leveraging the usefulness of linearly scaling the output representations of source adapters for transfer learning. We introduce SCALEARN, a simple and highly parametereffcient two-stage MTL method that capitalizes on the knowledge of the source tasks by learning a minimal set of scaling parameters that enable effective transfer to a target task. Our experiments on three benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE, and HumSet) and two encoder LMs show that SCALEARN consistently outperforms strong baselines with a small number of transfer parameters $\\\\langle\\\\sim0.35\\\\%$ of those of AdapterFusion). Remarkably, we observe that SCALEARN maintains its strong abilities even when further reducing parameters, achieving competitive results with only 8 transfer parameters per target task. Our proposed approach thus demonstrates the power of simple scaling as a promise for more effcient task transfer.1\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"With the wide availability of pre-trained language models (LMs) as the backbone of language processing, multi-task learning (MTL) has shown signifcant benefts, especially for tasks with possible conceptual commonalities (Ruder, 2017; Zhang and Yang, 2022; Raffel et al., 2020). The traditional paradigm in MTL is to formulate a joint optimization objective based on a set of tasks and train a single model to simultaneously learn and transfer the knowledge relevant to the tasks. This joint MTL approach can be realized by fne-tuning an LM (Liu et al., 2019a; Stickland and Murray, 2019), or, more recently, by using parameter-effcient, often modularized, MTL approaches (Mahabadi et al., 2021b; Zeng et al., 2023; Pilault et al., 2021; Asai et al., 2022; Ponti et al., 2023; Caccia et al., 2022).\\n\\nAs an alternative to the joint MTL paradigm, some works, such as ADAPTERFUSION (Pfeiffer et al., 2021), clearly distinguish task training from transfer learning, assigning dedicated parameters to each of these aspects. In this paradigm, referred to as two-stage MTL, frst each source task is trained separately and stored into a separate module like an adapter (Houlsby et al., 2019), and then a task transfer layer is trained for a given target task using information from an arbitrary set of source tasks. This separation of concerns between task and transfer learning offers valuable benefts: (1) Learning a separate transfer layer for each target task in a two-stage MTL approach reduces the potentially destructive effects of transfer learning on specifc tasks, as the transfer layer parameters corresponding to each target task can independently decide what information should be used from the available source tasks. As shown in our experiments with encoder LMs, this supports the effectiveness of transfer learning, making it less sensitive to task selection. (2) Since the source tasks can simply be taken from already trained modules (no need for retraining), two-stage approaches promote reusability \\u2013 a principle of Green AI (Scells et al., 2022; Schwartz et al., 2020). Further, they provide a practical solution to cases involving issues such as data privacy and\\/or fairness constraints, as a pre-trained module can readily provide the (e.g., already debiased) functionality of the source task even without the need to have access to its training data (Lauscher et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2023).\\n\\nDespite these benefts, current two-stage MTL solutions introduce signifcantly more learnable parameters compared to recent joint MTL ones, exacerbated by the linear increase in the number of parameters with the number of target tasks. In our experiment setup with eight target tasks using RoBERTaBASE (Liu et al., 2019b), ADAPTERFUSION introduces $\\\\sim\\\\!134\\\\%$ new parameters for transfer learning, while HYPERFORMER $^{++}$ (Mahabadi et al., 2021b) conducts joint MTL by adding $\\\\sim\\\\!4\\\\%$ $(\\\\approx\\\\,5\\\\mathrm{{M})}$ trainable parameters (details in Table 1 and $\\\\S5$ ). This high number of parameters is in stark contrast to the promise of Green AI given by the modularized nature of two-stage MTL.\\nContributions. We build on insights gained from analyzing the effects of scaling the output representations of adapters, and introduce SCALEARN, a novel two-stage MTL method that learns to transfer the knowledge of the source adapters using a small set of scaling parameters. For a given target task, SCALEARN introduces parameters that scale the output representation of each source adapter and combine the resulting scaled representations by simply taking the element-wise sum. This approach results in high parameter-effciency, such that \\u2013 following the mentioned experiment setting \\u2013 SCALEARN only adds $\\\\sim0.47\\\\%$ $(\\\\approx0.5\\\\mathsf{M})$ parameters. We further introduce an even more parameter-effcient variant via uniform scaling (SCALEARNUNIFORM), where each scaling vector is reduced to a single scaling parameter. Finally, by sharing parameters across layers, we achieve our most effcient variation (SCALEARNUNIFORM $^{++}$ ), only containing 64 parameters for transfer learning.\\n\\nWe conduct a large set of transfer learning experiments on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019b), SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a), and HumSet (Fekih et al., 2022) benchmarks using encoder LMs, namely the popular RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b) and XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) models, both in their base and large confgurations.\\nFigure 1 summarizes our results on GLUE and SuperGLUE, showing that SCALEARN, while providing high effciency and the benefts of the twostage MTL paradigm, consistently outperforms the baselines. The overall performance of SCALEARN remains highly competitive in its more parametereffcient variations. Our results also show the advantage of two-stage models in avoiding destructive effects during transfer learning. Overall, with SCALEARN we leverage the power of scaling as a viable, non-destructive, simple-to-implement, and highly parameter-effcient solution to the current shortcomings of existing MTL methods, paving the future for more effective and effcient task transfer.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Background\",\"section_content\":\"In task transfer learning, we consider a pre-trained LM as well as two sets $S$ and $T$ , representing the source and target tasks, respectively. The aim of MTL is to leverage the information of tasks in $S$ to improve the generalization on tasks in $T$ .\\nSingle Task Learning (STL). In this basic setting, a separate set of parameters is optimized on each task $\\\\left.S\\\\right.\\\\ =\\\\ {T})$ without any knowledge transfer between tasks. STL can be done by fnetuning the LM parameters or by introducing more parameter-effcient modules into the model, such as adapter modules (Pfeiffer adapters (Houlsby et al., 2019; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), PROPETL (Zeng et al., 2023), or COMPACTER $^{++}$ (Mahabadi et al., 2021a)), $(I A)^{3}$ (Liu et al., 2022), prefx-tuning (Li and Liang, 2021), or LoRA (Hu et al., 2022), each with $\\\\Theta_{s}$ parameters for each task $s$ .\\n\\nJoint MTL. This approach is commonly done by having a unifed model for all tasks $(S\\\\ =\\\\ T)$ , and a joint optimization objective that simultaneously optimizes the model using samples from all tasks (Ruder, 2017). The general joint MTL objective can be formulated as $\\\\begin{array}{r}{\\\\mathcal{L}_{\\\\mathrm{joint}}=\\\\sum_{s=1}^{|S|}\\\\alpha_{s}\\\\mathcal{L}_{s}}\\\\end{array}$ where $\\\\alpha_{s}$ is the sampling weight of  task $s$ . This optimization objective can be used to fne-tune the parameters of an LM (Liu et al., 2019a; Stickland and Murray, 2019; Raffel et al., 2020), or those of a modularized architecture (Mahabadi et al., 2021b; Pilault et al., 2021; Ponti et al., 2023). Despite the beneft of having one unifed model, the joint loss often causes tasks to compete with each other for learning capacity, leading to the task interference problem (Xin et al., 2022; McCloskey and Cohen, 1989; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). This makes the joint MTL paradigm particularly sensitive to the selection of tasks (Xin et al., 2022), while various methods in the literature have aimed to address this issue (e.g., Kendall et al. (2018); Pilault et al. (2021); a brief review is provided in $\\\\S\\\\ 6$ ).\\nTwo-stage MTL. In contrast to joint MTL, twostage MTL methods optimize each target task independently, bypassing the issue of task interference (Pfeiffer et al., 2021). Similarly to STL, a parameter-effcient module is frst learned for each source task $s$ with parameters $\\\\Theta_{s}$ . In principle, twostage MTL methods can simply use already pretrained modules (such as adapters), saving the costs of re-training modules on each task. This facilitates the re-use of existing parameter-effcient modules for each source task,2 which may vary in performance and\\/or take into account additional constraints such as fairness and bias mitigation (Pfeiffer et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023; Lauscher et al., 2021). Moreover, it also removes the need for accessing the training data of the source tasks (e.g., due to data privacy) so far as the source task\\u2019s functionality is solely provided via parameter-effcient modules. Next, given $|S|$ (pre-trained and frozen) source task modules, two-stage MTL methods defne and optimize a transfer layer for each target task to leverage the knowledge of source tasks to solve the target task. This stage introduces $\\\\Omega_{t}$ new parameters for each target task $t$ .\\n\\nADAPTERFUSION (Pfeiffer et al., 2021) introduces an implementation of the two-stage approach with strong performance (Pfeiffer et al., 2023). It uses an attention mechanism as its transfer layer, inserted into each LM layer after the source adapters. More specifcally, given the output vector of each source adapter $s$ in each layer $l$ , referred to as $o_{s}^{l}$ , the attention layer (with target task $t$ as query and source tasks $S$ as keys and values) learns to assign a weight $\\\\omega_{s}^{l}$ to each source task. The fnal output of the target task $t$ in this layer is calculated as:\\nRegardless of how the weights are calculated, the method can be seen as a weighted summation of source output vectors, where the weights form a categorical probability distribution.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"3 SCALEARN \\u2013 Learning to Scale for Knowledge Transfer\",\"section_content\":\"To understand the effect of scaling the output representations of adapters, we conducted initial experiments on scaling them, both in isolation and when combining two of them. In these experiments, we observed that (1) scaling output vectors is an effective method for controlling the (partial or full) activation of the knowledge contained in an adapter module; (2) an optimal confguration of the scaling parameter will, in many cases, lead to superior results on the target task; (3) the optimal weights do not necessarily sum up to 1. These fndings stand in contrast to the established practice of forcing the coeffcients to sum up to 1 (e.g., as in ADAPTERFUSION; cf. Equation 1). We provide comprehensive results and analyses in Appendix A.2. Overall, these observations provide strong motivation for a method to combine representations from several adapters by scaling their output representations.\\nBased on that, we present SCALEARN, a novel two-stage transfer learning method to combine the knowledge of source adapters by scaling their output representations. Our core contribution regards the transfer layer, built on the output of the tasks\\u2019 modular networks. Similar to Pfeiffer et al. (2021), we utilize adapter modules for the task learning layer. In particular, the output representation of the adapter of source task $s$ at layer $l$ is defned as: $\\\\pmb{\\\\mathscr{o}}_{s}^{l}=\\\\pmb{U}_{s}^{l}(\\\\operatorname{ReLU}(\\\\pmb{D}_{s}^{l}(\\\\pmb{x}_{s}^{l})))+\\\\pmb{x}_{s}^{l}$ , where $\\\\pmb{x}_{s}^{l}$ is the input vector, and $U_{s}^{l}$ and $D_{s}^{l}$ denote the up- and down-projection parameter matrices, respectively.\\n\\nOur introduced SCALEARN linearly scales and combines the output representations of source adapters, $o_{1}^{l},\\\\dots,o_{|S|}^{l}$ , to achieve the objective of target task $t$ .\\nWe defne two variations of the scaling operation: non-uniform which applies a scaling vector to each output vector using the element-wise product (SCALEARN), and the more parameter-effcient uniform that scales each vector only with a scalar parameter (SCALEARNUNIFORM). These variations are formulated below:\\ndistributional properties on the $\\\\omega$ values, as commonly imposed in previous work (Pfeiffer et al., 2021; Chronopoulou et al., 2023; Xin et al., 2022) through functions such as softmax and average.\\nParameter-effciency of SCALEARN. To have a clear view of the parameter-effciency of the models, we continue by analyzing the number of learnable parameters in the transfer layer. The SCALEARN variant introduces $d\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!L\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!|S|$ transfer parameters for a single target task, where $d$ is the embedding size and $L$ denotes the number of layers. The total number of parameters for all target tasks then becomes $d\\\\times L\\\\times|S|\\\\times|T|$ . Moving to SCALEARNUNIFORM, this number reduces to $L\\\\times\\\\left|S\\\\right|\\\\times\\\\left|T\\\\right|$ . The SCALEARN++ spares the $L$ term and has $d\\\\times|S|\\\\times|T|$ transfer parameters. Finally, the most parameter-effcient variant SCALEARNUNIFO $)\\\\mathrm{RM}++$ only adds $|S|\\\\times|T|$ parameters. For each task, new task head parameters are learned jointly with the transfer parameters.\\nwhere $\\\\odot$ denotes the Hadamard product, and $\\\\omega_{s}^{l}$ and $\\\\omega_{s}^{l}$ are learnable vector and scalar parameters, respectively. Inspired by previous studies (Mahabadi et al., 2021a; Zeng et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Goldberg, 2019), we further increase parameter-effciency by learning shared scaling parameters among all layers, formulated as follows:\\nFor comparison, the number of transfer parameters of ADAPTERFUSION is $3{\\\\times}d^{2}{\\\\times}L{\\\\times}|T|$ (discarding bias and task head parameters), corresponding to the query, key, and value matrices of the attention mechanism. Comparing the formulas, we observe that our methods are far more parameter-effcient, since in practice $|S|\\\\ll d$ , and hence the $d\\\\!\\\\times\\\\!L$ term in SCALEARN becomes much smaller than $d^{2}$ in ADAPTERFUSION. Compared to the joint MTL paradigm, despite the linear increase of parameters with $|T|$ , our SCALEARN \\\\* models still provide high parameter-effciency. This stems from the fact that $|T|\\\\ll d$ , and hence reducing the effect of $d-$ which is fully eliminated in the uniform variants \\u2013 leaves a stronger impact on parameter-effciency.\\nwhere, similarly, $\\\\omega_{s}$ and $\\\\omega_{s}$ are learnable vector and scalar parameters, but shared among all layers. In all the mentioned methods, to optimize the transfer parameters $\\\\Omega$ , we use gradient descent as an easy-to-implement and straightforward solution. On the basis of our experiments, we fnd that our approach provides highly competitive results on a wide range of tasks (cf. $\\\\S\\\\ 5$ ). Furthermore, SCALEARN models do not force any\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"4 Experiment Setup\",\"section_content\":\"Tasks and datasets. We conduct our experiments on the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks, respectively, each consisting of 8 tasks, as well as on the HumSet benchmark (Fekih et al., 2022). HumSet is a multilingual classifcation dataset for humanitarian crisis response that consists of 5 tasks. Additionally, we use a combination of all GLUE and SuperGLUE tasks resulting in 15 datasets3. It has been shown that tasks from GLUE and SuperGLUE particularly beneft from multi-task learning, given their partially overlapping task formulations and highly varying dataset sizes (Devlin et al., 2019;\\nStickland and Murray, 2019; Asai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Complete details regarding the benchmarks including their train\\/validation\\/test splits are provided in Appendix A.1.\\nLM backbones. We use the encoder LMs RoBERTaBASE and RoBERTaLARGE (Liu et al., 2019b) on GLUE and SuperGLUE. For the experiments on HumSet, following Fekih et al. (2022) we utilize the commonly used multilingual encoder LMs XLM-RBASE and XLM-RLARGE (Conneau et al., 2020) as it consists of multiple languages.\\nWe put our focus on encoder LMs since they have been studied extensively and are still widely used for a variety of tasks, e.g., representation learning (Kusupati et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023), sentence segmentation (Minixhofer et al., 2023), and as language encoder as part of multi-modal architectures (Saharia et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023), inter alia, especially in real-time use cases due to their effciency and comparatively low computational demands.\\nModels and baselines. We conduct experiments on four variants of our model, namely SCALEARN, SCALEARNUNIFORM, SCALEA $\\\\mathbf{RN++}$ , and SCALEARNUNIFORM $^{++}$ . As a direct baseline, we compare our models with ADAPTERFUSION, a common two-stage MTL method that shares similar conceptual properties. We also compare our models with ADAPTERSOUP (Chronopoulou et al., 2023), performing weight-space averaging over adapter weights of the 5 most similar tasks according to their sentence similarity, adapted to our setup (cf. Appendix A.1). In all two-stage MTL methods, source and target tasks are the same, containing the tasks of the underlying benchmark. For each target task, they learn a transfer layer (except for ADAPTERSOUP) and a new task head.\\n\\nWe also select a set of strong STL baselines: FINETUNE, fully fne-tuning the LM, ADAPTER (Houlsby et al., 2019) learning an adapter module for each task, PROPETL (Zeng et al., 2023) a more memory-effcient variation based on parameter sparsifcation and COMPACTE $\\\\mathbf{R++}$ (Mahabadi et al., 2021a) a highly parameter-effcient variation using parametersharing between layers. In addition, we train $(\\\\mathbf{IA})^{3}$ (Liu et al., 2022), learning scaling vectors applied to the key and value matrices and intermediate activations in the LM\\u2019s feed-forward layer, and LORA (Hu et al., 2022), learning low-rank updates to the model\\u2019s weight matrices.\\nFurthermore, we conduct experiments on several joint MTL baselines, namely FINETUNE-M, ADAPTER-M, and PROPETL-M, the fully fnetuned, adapter-based, and ProPETL-based joint MTL variants, respectively; and, fnally, HYPERFORMER and HYPERFORMER $^{++}$ (Karimi Mahabadi et al., 2021). FINETUNE-M updates all LM parameters, ADAPTER-M adds a single adapter module shared for all tasks, and PROPETL-M combines sparse layer- and task-specifc masks through a logical OR operation. Based on task-specifc embeddings, HYPERFORMER and HYPERFORMER++ generate module parameters by a shared hypernetwork. In all adapter-based models, we use a reduction factor of 16, and, following Pfeiffer et al. (2021), insert the modules after the feed-forward layer of the LM. Furthermore, to allow a fair comparison, we adapt PROPETL-M, HYPERFORMER, and HYPERFORMER $^{++}$ to this setting by inserting the adapters only after each feed-forward block. To accommodate possible variations in performance, we train each model on multiple seeds, and report the mean and standard deviation over multiple runs.\\nThe full details of the experiment setup regarding the benchmarks and their splits, infrastructure, training, and hyperparameters are provided in $\\\\S\\\\,\\\\mathrm{A}.1$ .

Moreover, the SCALEARN models still remain comparable when also taking into account the source adapter parameters. Considering these results, in the following we report and discuss the evaluation results in transfer learning and few-shot learning on the respective benchmarks.\"}\n\nIn total, 5 rows are displayed in JSON format."}

However, the tables themselves are not included in the text. I will extract the relevant information about the overall best models and the best two-stage MTL models based on the discussion of results in these sections.
