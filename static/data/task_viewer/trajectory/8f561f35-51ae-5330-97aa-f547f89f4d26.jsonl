{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Additional evaluations can be found in Appendix F.\\n4.1\\nGeneralizability and adaptability\\nSetup. We first show the superior performance of our scenario-adaptive model by comparing SA2D\\nwith the FSAD model [46] on CUHK Avenue. To demonstrate the enhanced anomaly detection\\nperformance of our MSAD dataset, we train two adaptive models: one using ShanghaiTech, and the\\nother leveraging our MSAD. For all experiments, we maintain N = 7 and K = 10 to ensure a fair\\ncomparison. Our training process spans over 1500 epochs. Throughout all evaluations, we consider\\nboth Micro and Macro AUC scores. We conduct two sets of experiments: (1) In the single-scenario \\/\\ncross-view evaluation, the model is trained and tested on the same scenario. To facilitate a comparison\\nwith the view-adaptive anomaly detection model [46], we partition the ShanghaiTech dataset into\\n7 scenes (views), specifically, scene 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 for training as in [46].

For model\\ntraining, we use either ShanghaiTech or our MSAD.\\nSingle-scenario evaluation. As illustrated in Table 2, our model is trained on seven camera views\\nof the ShanghaiTech dataset and tested on the remaining views, such as v1, v3, and so forth. The\\nperformance in cross-view evaluation falls short compared to our SA2D. Notably, our SA2D, trained\\non our MSAD and tested on ShanghaiTech, exhibits significantly superior performance compared to\\nthe view-adaptive model. This disparity in performance may stem from: (i) the constraint of limited\\ntraining views, preventing the model from effectively adapting to novel viewpoints, (ii) the camera\\nview being tested on at ShanghaiTech is significantly different, almost equivalent to a novel scenario\\nconcept. Therefore, the view-adaptive model is unable to adapt to such novel scenarios.\\nCross-scenario evaluation. Our model, trained on MSAD, demonstrates superior performance\\ncompared to the view-adaptive model (see Table 3, Ped2 and CUHK refer to UCSD Ped2 and CUHK\\nAvenue datasets). For instance, on CUHK Avenue, our model outperforms the view-adaptive model\\nby 9.6% and 6.2% for Micro and Macro evaluation metrics, respectively. Furthermore, our SA2D,\\ntrained and tested on MSAD, consistently achieves excellent performance. It\\u2019s important to note that\\nour MSAD test set is distinct from the MSAD training set, covering a diverse range of novel scenarios.\\nThese results underscore the robustness of our model in cross-scenario evaluations. However, we\\nalso observe a performance drop on ShanghaiTech (v6). The decline in performance is attributed\\nto the dataset deviating from real-life scenarios, as it categorizes biking and driving as anomalies, a\\nclassification that does not align with reality.\\nInsights on single- and cross-scenario evaluations. Based on the aforementioned experiments, we\\ncan deduce that a model trained on intricate real-world scenarios exhibits superior generalization.\\nThis stems from the fact that real-world models are frequently influenced by the surrounding environ-\\nment, encompassing elements like fluctuating traffic patterns, dynamic electronic displays, and the\\nmovement of trees in the wind. The model must discern the nuances of anomaly detection within a\\ndynamic environment and comprehend the dynamics of objects and\\/or performing subjects within it.\\nOur MSAD dataset provides a comprehensive representation of real-world scenarios.\\nScene information is implicitly used as weak supervision. The scene information provided is used\\nin the few-shot sampling strategy, where each scenario is treated as a group for sampling purposes.\\nThis allows the model to learn information from multiple scenarios in a balanced manner (see Fig. 6 in\\nAppendix D). In our proposed model, SA2D, scene information is used during the sampling process\\nto form N-way K-shot learning. Table 2\\u2019s last four columns compare the performance (i) without\\nscene information (FSAD) and (ii) with scene information (our SA2D) on our MSAD dataset (note\\nthat both models are trained using MSAD). The primary difference between FSAD and SA2D is that\\nSA2D uses scene information during sampling to enhance the N-way K-shot learning framework.\\nAs shown in Table 2, our sampling strategy (Appendix D) significantly boosts SA2D\\u2019s performance\\nacross all five test splits on different camera viewpoints in ShanghaiTech.\\n4There are no test videos for scene 13, so we only consider 5 views during testing.\\n8\\nTable 4: Comparison of six methods with varying backbones on UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech, and our\\nMSAD dataset using three popular backbones: C3D, I3D, and SwinTransformer (SwinT).\\nVenue\\nUCF-Crime\\nShanghaiTech\\nMSAD\\nC3D\\nI3D SwinT C3D\\nI3D SwinT I3D SwinT\\nMIST [22]\\nCVPR 2021 81.40 82.30\\n-\\n93.13 94.83\\n-\\n-\\n-\\nRTFM [90]\\nICCV 2021\\n83.28 83.14 83.31 91.51 97.94 96.76 86.65 85.67\\nMSL [40]\\nAAAI 2022\\n82.85 85.30 85.62 94.23 95.45 97.32\\n-\\n-\\nUR-DMU [129]\\nAAAI 2023\\n82.65 86.19 83.74 94.67 96.15 95.71 85.02 72.36\\nMGFN [14]\\nAAAI 2023\\n82.37 83.44 84.30 90.82 93.97 93.58 84.96 78.94\\nTEVAD [13]\\nCVPRW 2023 83.39 84.54 84.65 92.05 98.10 97.63 86.82 83.60\\n4.2\\nPractical applicability and effectiveness\\nSetup. We focus on weakly-supervised learning methods from a practical perspective. We select six\\nrecent representative methods for evaluation: MIST [22], RTFM [90], MSL [40], UR-DMU [129],\\nMGFN [14], and TEVAD [13]. These methods provide open-source implementations, allowing us to\\nexplore the impact of different backbone choices. Each method has its unique focus. MIST introduces\\na multiple instance self-training framework to refine task-specific discriminative representations using\\nonly video-level annotations. RTFM trains a feature magnitude learning function to identify positive\\ninstances, enhancing the robustness of the multiple instance learning approach. MSL uses multi-\\nsequence learning to predict both video-level anomaly probabilities and snippet-level anomaly scores.\\nUR-DMU focuses on learning representations of normal data while extracting discriminative features\\nfrom abnormal data for a better understanding of normal states. MGFN proposes a glance-and-focus\\nnetwork to amplify the discriminative power of feature magnitudes across different scenes. TEVAD\\nuses both visual and text features to complement spatio-temporal features with semantic meanings of\\nabnormal events. These methods enable us to conduct a fair and comprehensive evaluation across\\nvarious aspects.\\nIn line with the standard practice in [90, 40, 129], we use C3D [91], I3D [9], SwinTransformer\\n[44] pretrained on Kinetics-400, as backbone networks for feature extraction. Although the same\\nbackbone is used, different methods may extract features of varying dimensions. For example,\\nUR-DMU and MSL extracts 1024-dim features, whereas other methods extract 2048-dim features\\nwhen using I3D as the backbone. To ensure a fair comparison, following RTFM, we extract 4096-dim\\nfeatures from the \\u2018fc6\\u2019 layer of C3D, 2048-dim, 10-crop features from the \\u2018mix 5c\\u2019 layer of I3D,\\nrespectively. Additionally, following MSL, we extract 1024-dim features from SwinTransformer. We\\napply these feature extraction processes on ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime and our MSAD. Then we use\\nthese extracted features as inputs of different methods. We rigorously maintain original parameters to\\nreproduce reported results from previous studies, and conduct our own evaluations using Protocol ii.\\nWe use the Micro AUC metric for evaluation.\\nEvaluation on methods. Table 4 shows the results. As shown in the table, there is no single best\\nperformer across all three datasets. However, on ShanghaiTech with I3D as the backbone, TEVAD\\nemerges as the top performer. This demonstrates the efficacy of using text descriptions in video\\nanomaly detection. The second-best performer is RTFM, followed by UR-DMU.\\nEvaluation on backbones. For MSL, we observe that SwinTransformer outperforms I3D, and I3D\\noutperforms C3D. Specifically, on UCF-Crime, SwinTransformer as a backbone performs better than\\nusing I3D. However, on our MSAD dataset, I3D performs better than SwinTransformer. The potential\\nreason for this behavior is that UCF-Crime generally contains longer videos, and SwinTransformer is\\ngood at capturing long-term motions.\\nMSAD is sensitive to the choice of backbones. We notice that our dataset is sensitive to the choice of\\nbackbones, particularly for methods like UR-DMU and MGFN (Table 4). Existing backbones, such as\\nC3D, I3D, and SwinTransformer, have demonstrated strong performance in video anomaly detection\\non current datasets (see Table 4 for results on UCF-Crime and ShanghaiTech). However, these datasets\\nhave significant limitations: (i) they cover a very limited range of scenarios, motion dynamics, and\\nanomaly types, and (ii) most anomaly detection methods rely on action recognition pre-trained\\nmodels as backbones for feature extraction, particularly for human-related anomalies. As a result,\\nthese backbones tend to perform well because the anomaly detection datasets predominantly feature\\nhuman-related motions. In contrast, our dataset introduces more challenges in terms of scenarios,\\n9\\ncamera viewpoints, and motion dynamics, including both human and non-human-related motions.\\nOverall, using I3D as the backbone yields better results compared to using SwinTransformer. RTFM\\nis robust to the choice of backbones, with the performance gap between I3D and SwinTransformer\\nbeing within 1%.\\nOur dataset can be used for selecting appropriate model backbones or exploring more powerful\\nbackbone networks that do not overly depend on existing action recognition models. Additionally, our\\ndataset advances video anomaly detection by considering a wider range of scenarios and a broader\\nspectrum of anomaly types.\\n4.3\\nLimitations of current methods on our new dataset\\nHere, we discuss the limitations of current methods and provide additional insights on our MSAD\\ndataset.\\nI3D vs. SwinTransformer. Using I3D as a backbone generally outperforms SwinTransformer. Al-\\nthough SwinTransformer excels in capturing local and global spatial features, its reliance on attention\\nmechanisms for temporal modeling may not be as finely tuned to detect subtle anomalies. I3D, de-\\nsigned to maintain temporal consistency across frames, is better suited for detecting anomalies that are\\ntemporally localized, e.g., sudden object appearances or unexpected behaviors. SwinTransformer\\u2019s\\nattention-based approach may lack the temporal coherence needed for such tasks. Additionally,\\nI3D\\u2019s focus on motion and spatiotemporal features aligns well with anomaly detection requirements,\\nespecially in motion-based anomalies and subtle temporal variations present in our dataset.\\nBoosting existing methods. Models trained on our dataset exhibit better generalizability and\\nadaptability, particularly under few-shot settings (Table 2), showing superior performance on unseen\\ncamera viewpoints. Our SA2D model, trained on MSAD (Table 3), significantly boosts performance.\\nAdditionally, our dataset enhances the performance of existing anomaly detection methods (Table 7\\nin the Appendix). Models trained on MSAD consistently achieve the best performance on anomalies\\nsuch as fighting, fire, object falling, shooting, traffic accidents, and water incidents, addressing the\\nchallenge of lacking a comprehensive benchmark dataset for model training.\\nNo single best performer on MSAD. RTFM and TEVAD are more robust to backbone changes than\\nUR-DMU and MGFN (see Table 4). This suggests that existing methods may lack comprehensive\\nevaluations across diverse scenarios. Our dataset provides a solid benchmark for training, testing, and\\nevaluating superior models.\\nSupporting multi-scenario anomaly detection. Our dataset benefits multi-scenario anomaly de-\\ntection, enabling systematic evaluation across multiple scenarios (Table 8 in the Appendix). Recent\\nmethods trained on MSAD generally achieve better performance across all 14 scenarios, demonstrat-\\ning that existing works have primarily focused on single-scenario detection. Our dataset offers a\\nrobust foundation for training superior models for multi-scenario anomaly evaluation.\\nRethinking anomaly detection. Our dataset encourages rethinking the correctness and trustwor-\\nthiness of anomaly detection methods. Cross-dataset evaluation (Table 9 in the Appendix) reveals\\nthat existing datasets (Table 1) may suffer from unrealistic anomaly definitions. For instance, mod-\\nels pre-trained on MSAD perform poorly on ShanghaiTech but better on CUHK and UCSD Ped2,\\nhighlighting the misalignment of anomaly categories like biking and driving with reality.\\n5\"}\n\n... # only display 1 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
