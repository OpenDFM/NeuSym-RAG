{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Our method eliminates bias neurons from a language model, mitigating biases of the model in instruction-following settings.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"1 Introduction\",\"section_content\":\"Instruction-following language models perform various tasks using instruction-based prompts (Chung et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Taori et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023). However, language models have suffered from undesirable biases, failing to follow user instructions despite their signifcant competency (Tamkin et al., 2021; Weidinger et al., 2021; Bender et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021). Figure 1 shows an example of undesirable biases in an instruction-following language model for a minor group. In this case, a language model assigns a high probability to a minor group label for a negative question despite the ambiguity of the given context. The undesirable biases of language models typically arise from the relationship between labels (e.g., \\\"poor people\\\") and tokens (e.g., \\\"drugs\\\") within data instances (Zhao et al., 2021; Fei et al., 2023).\\n\\nHowever, the association between labels and instructions also causes a critical bias since various instructions affect language models to behave inconsistently. Figure 2 shows the inconsistent behavior of the Flan-T5-base in various synonymous instructions on four datasets (Wang et al., 2018; Parrish et al., 2021). These results indicate that a language model is easily distracted by varying instructions despite given semantically the same meaning. These phenomena suggest that language models exhibit signifcant cognitive biases in understanding instructions, and these are some of the most critical biases to mitigate when using instruction-following language models.\\n\\nTo mitigate biases in language models, Zhao et al. (2021); Fei et al. (2023) have investigated label biases in few-shot in-context learning settings. Specifcally, they have regarded the imbalanced probability distribution that occurred by inputting content-free texts (e.g., \\\"N\\/A\\\" or random tokens) as biases, and degraded the original output probability of each input instance by the output probability of the content-free texts. However, they have only aimed to mitigate biases in few-shot in-context learning settings, not considering the zero-shot instruction prompting. Since utilizing a language model in only the instruction prompting without few-shot examples is an effcient and practical usage scenario of language models, they have signifcant limitations in the scope of application.\\nTo resolve these issues, in this paper, we frst defne the bias neuron, which signifcantly affects biased outputs in language models. Prior studies (Panigrahi et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022; Panigrahi et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) have demonstrated that skills for a specifc task are localized in particular neurons. From these fndings, we hypothesize the presence of the bias neuron and empirically validate its existence. Furthermore, we propose a novel bias mitigation method called CRISPR, which stands for CalibRating InStruction Bias via Bias Neuron PRuning. We utilize an attribution (Yang et al., 2023), an explainability method for language models, to quantify the bias of each neuron at three aspects (i.g., token, instance, and instruction). Specifcally, we frst compute the bias infuence of each token in inferring a predefned biased output, and aggregate the token score to an instance and instruction scores to derive the fnal bias infuence (bias attribution) of each neuron. Furthermore, defning biased outputs manually for each data instance is time-consuming; thus, we propose an automatic identifcation method of biased outputs for computing the bias attribution using the confusion score of a language model.\\n\\nWe demonstrate our method in various social bias and natural language understanding benchmarks and dramatically outperform other baselines under varying zero-shot instruction settings. Surprisingly, we reveal that only a few bias neurons (at least three) cause the bias, proving our method\\u2019s practicality. In addition, we show that mitigating bias for a particular task does not adversely affect the existing knowledge of language models for solving other tasks. We also note that bias neurons identifed for a specifc dataset also function as biases in other analogous datasets, revealing that the bias knowledge is transferred to datasets from correlative domains. CRISPR is an effcient bias mitigation method since it needs only a few data samples (e.g., ten samples) to quantify the bias score for the whole neurons. CRISPR also enables language models to adapt fexibly by eliminating some existing bias neurons without any training process.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2 Related Works\",\"section_content\":\"\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.1 Bias Mitigation\",\"section_content\":\"Despite demonstrating signifcant effcacy in various natural language understanding tasks, Language Models (LLMs) have been noted to exhibit undesirable biases (Ravfogel et al., 2019; Braverman et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021; Bommasani et al., 2021; Work; Sorensen et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023; Koh et al., 2024). Therefore, existing studies have attempted to solve the bias problems. For instance, Zhao et al. (2021); Fei et al. (2023) have mitigated biases found in few-shot incontext learning settings by utilizing outputs probability obtained from content-free texts (e.g. \\\"N\\/A\\\" or random tokens). They have argued that an imbalanced output probability for the content-free texts corresponds to unintended label biases. Specifcally, they have shifted the original output probability of each input instance by dividing it through the output probability of each class obtained from content-free texts. However, existing studies have limitations in that they have only aimed to mitigate biases in the few-shot in-context learning setting. Since more realistic LLM usage settings are based on the zero-shot instruction-following mechanism, it is essential to consider these settings to suggest a practical bias mitigation method. Furthermore, the existing studies have only tackled the simple classifcation problem as a target to mitigate biases. To enhance the scalability of bias mitigation methods, they should demonstrate effectiveness in real-world natural language understanding tasks that involve handling diverse and inconsistent label options.\"}\n{\"section_title\":\"2.2 Skill Neurons Detection\",\"section_content\":\"Despite the impressive performance of language models, it is challenging to precisely illuminate the role of each parameter in models during the execution of a specifc task.

Specifcally, they have computed the mean activation value of all data instances for a specifc neuron and examined whether the activation obtained from each class is well distinguished based on the mean activation. However, applying this method to language modeling tasks poses challenges since it requires overwhelming computation to examine all word-piece combinations to determine the distinguishing ability of neurons.\\nYang et al. (2023) has detected skill neurons by utilizing the attribution technique (Shrikumar et al., 2016), an explainability method that derives the importance of each feature when solving a specifc task.

Since the negative values of the attribution score are undesirable negative importance for a specifc task, it is reasonable to exclude that information.\\nAutomatic Identifcation of Biased Labels. We should determine a biased text to compute the bias attribution for each input instance. However, determining all the biased text manually for the whole instance is time-consuming and ineffcient. For example, the BBQ-SES dataset, a socioeconomic status bias dataset, contains various different text labels for the protected group, such as poor people, low-income people, the truck driver, etc. Thus, if we consider the realistic application of our method, then we have to determine the biased text automatically. Specifcally, we utilize the confusion score of the language model to derive an undesirable biased class (i.e., text) for each instance as follows:\\nwhere $t_{k}\\\\in x_{j}$ means each token of an input text. $B_{i}^{(\\\\iota,x_{j},t_{k})}(h)$ is the attribution score computed for each token $t_{k}$ .\\nInstance Aggregation. Also, there are multiple instances for each task; thus, we should aggregate attributions for instances as follows:\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{D}$ and $N$ mean a specifc dataset and the number of instances in the dataset, respectively.

I will extract the specific calculation method from this section to format it as a Python string.\n[Action]:\nGenerateAnswer(answer='B_{i}^{(\\\\iota,x)}(h) = \\tilde{A}_{i}^{(\\\\iota,x,y)}(h) - A_{i}^{(\\\\iota,\\x08ar{x},y)}(h) \\text{ (with negative values converted to zero)}')"}
