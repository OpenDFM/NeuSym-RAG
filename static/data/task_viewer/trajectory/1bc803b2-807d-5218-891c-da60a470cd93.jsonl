{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Since we need to start from models that already have zero-shot QA ability, we choose only MACAW for the encoder-decoder models. For the decoder-only model, we follow similar approaches to Tafjord and Clark (2021) to train OPT models with a fraction of UnifedQA dataset (Khashabi et al., 2020) in order to steer the model into QA mode 4 without injecting much additional knowledge. We select the model size that can achieve non-trivial performance using 256 pairs of data for this experiment.\\n\\nTo discriminate and generate explanations jointly, we let the models generate the discriminating tokens: \\u201ctricky question\\u201d or \\u201ctrue question\\u201d frst. Then the model continues to generate the explanation to FPQs or the answer to TPQs. Since the numbers of tokens responsible for discrimination and generation differ dramatically, we add an additional binary loss on the discriminating tokens. The ratio between the binary loss and the generation loss is 1. We conduct experiments on three training data sizes, i.e, 32, 256, and 1187 question pairs.\\nIn evaluation, if a generated answer contains \\u201ctricky question\\u201d, we consider the question classifed as an FPQ, otherwise, it is classifed as a TPQ. Similar to the previous section, we report the recall, precision of predicting FPQs, and accuracy of the binary classifcation. In addition, we evaluate the quality of the generated explanation by computing the maximum ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004) score between it and the two ground-truth explanations. Note since we focus on the explanation of FPQs, the evaluation does not include the TPQs.\\nFrom Table 7, we have three observations. (1) The models jointly predict the question and generate answers successfully. (2) When training data is limited, e.g., 32 question pairs, the accuracy is signifcantly higher than conducting classifcation alone (See in Figure 3), which shows that the explanations of the FPQs help the model to quickly adapt to the task. (3) Adding binary loss boosts the model\\u2019s performance on classifcation. For the generated explanations, the best ROUGE-L achieves 42.0, showing that the explanations are close to humans\\u2019. The quality of explanations also gets higher as the model size and data size increase. We provide the model-generated explanation for 10 randomly sampled FPQs in Appendix C.2. We can see the explanations are reasonable.\\n\\nTable 8: Performance of in-context learning under different numbers of examples.

Increasing the coverage of questions is proven to be benefcial (Khashabi et al., 2020). However, asking annotators to write FPQs freely does not guarantee the coverage of the questions. Therefore, the authors manually think up 29 initial FPQs (see Appendix A.1). Then we categorize these FPQs in terms of error types, and question format. We summarize the categories in Table 3. In total, there are eight error types covering commonsense errors, logical errors, etc., and six question formats covering factual questions, descriptive questions, etc. Although we try to collect as many examples as possible into the initial set, the categorizations are far from exhaustive. Therefore we include an \\u201cOthers\\u201d option to encourage creativity.\\nWriting FPQs. We recruit twenty human annotators to think up questions that contain false premises. To make the creative process easier, we provide source words to the annotators to compose sentences. We use the subject word of GenericsKB (Bhakthavatsalam et al., 2020) as the source word since they have broad coverage and each word is paired with a short illustrative sentence that can also inspire the annotators. However, we don\\u2019t require the annotated sentence to contain the source word. Moreover, the annotators have the freedom to skip the source words that are not easy to brainstorm. We then ask the annotators to categorize the questions into the above categories. The annotators are required to keep a balanced distribution (see Appendix A.2) over categories when they fnish their part. For the quality of the written FPQs, we require them to be correct in syntax and contain obvious false premises.\\n\\nRevising into TPQs. Previous studies (Du et al., 2021) point out that PLMs are skilled at fnding shortcuts in datasets and do not really understand the task. Since the FPQs are created manually, it\\u2019s easy to fall into the fxed writing style of the annotators. To alleviate the problem, we annotate a comparison set for these FPQs. Specifcally, we ask annotators to edit each FPQ with minimal modifcations to make it a problem with true premises (TPQ). The resulting pairs of questions differ only in the correctness of the premises, ensuring that the model learns the essentials of the task.\\nWriting Detailed Explanations\\/Answers. Humans usually reply to FPQs with an explanation of why the premise is false (Kaplan, 1978). Generating the explanation also helps check whether the model truly understands the FPQs. Therefore, we ask the annotators to write an explanation for each FPQ. For quality control of the explanations, we require the explanation to be more than the negation of the false premise. For the training set and validation set, we require one explanation per question, for the test set, we require two explanations per question. For symmetry, the annotators also write answers to the TPQs. The full annotating process is demonstrated in Figure 2.\"}\n{\"score\":34.7009,\"pdf_id\":\"529875d6-5189-5c4d-9076-1635a01a862d\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"fd57272c-9a17-5a82-8aa0-d548d7152d30\",\"text\":\"Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) (Lewis et al., 2020; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; Roller et al., 2021; Han et al., 2021) have achieved signifcant performance gains for various types of tasks, even surpassing human levels on language ability benchmarks (Wang et al., 2018, 2019; Srivastava et al., 2022). The\\nTable 1: Some previous examples that report the vulnerability of PLMs to tricky questions. More examples provided by this work are in Table 2.\\nunprecedented ability of PLMs lays the foundation for various practical applications. For example, PLMs that exhibit general world knowledge and commonsense knowledge have the potential to serve as backbones for general-purpose questionanswering models (Tafjord and Clark, 2021; Guu et al., 2020).\\nHowever, these PLM-based question-answering models have an intriguing paradox. On the one hand, they achieve high performance on normal questions raised by humans. For example, UNIFIEDQA (Khashabi et al., 2020) achieves state-ofthe-art performance on many question-answering tasks. MACAW (Tafjord and Clark, 2021) can perform multi-angle question-answering and answer $75\\\\%$ of the question in the Challenge300 dataset (Tafjord and Clark, 2021) correctly. On the other hand, they are vulnerable to tricky questions (see Table 1). For example, MACAW answers one out of nine tricky questions correctly, while other models including GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) fail all of them (Tafjord and Clark, 2021). InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) also reports that it fails to identify instructions with false premises. These questions are easy to rebut for humans but pose an undeniable obstacle for $\\\\mathrm{PLMs}^{3}$ . The inability to rebut also results in the misalignment (Kenton et al., 2021) of language models to human expectations.\\n\\nWithout careful investigation, this paradox could easily lead to the conclusion that PLMs lack the world or commonsense knowledge to rebut these questions. Although it\\u2019s crucial for the PLMs to embed as much general knowledge as possible, we provide a pilot experiment to fnd out that the PLMs already possess the knowledge required for the tricky questions which they fail (see Section 3.2). As a consequence, we hypothesize that the knowledge in current PLMs is enough for handling a large portion of tricky questions. However, this knowledge is not activated.\\nTo support our hypothesis, we take a close look at these tricky questions. Most of these tricky questions contain false premises. For example, in the question \\u201cHow many eyes does the sun have?\\u201d, the questioner must presume that \\u201cthe sun can have eyes\\u201d in order to make the query about the quantity meaningful. These questions are called False Premise Questions (FPQs). Such false premises always violate human knowledge or logic and rarely appear in the natural text, thus leading to an out-ofdistribution generalization gap for the PLMs.\\nTargeting to fll the gap between the natural text and FPQs, we present the frst specialized dataset of FPQs, dubbed as FalseQA dataset. Specifcally, we frst systematically categorize the false premises to ensure the coverage of the dataset. Then we ask human annotators to manually compose the FPQs, as well as explanations for the false premises. The annotators are also asked to edit the false premise questions into true premise questions (TPQs) using minimal modifcation, with which the PLMs are less prone to learn shortcuts from the format of FPQs.\\nBased on FalseQA dataset, we frst conduct systematic experiments on the PLMs\\u2019 discrimination and rebuttal ability of FPQs. We reach three essential conclusions: (1) PLMs of different types and scales can distinguish the FPQs from TPQs, and scaling effect (Kaplan et al., 2020) also holds for FalseQA. (2) PLMs can give reasonable explanations for the false premises, which can serve as rebuttals. (3) The number of FPQ examples needed to activate the PLM\\u2019s rebuttal ability is moderate. For example, 256 FPQs can result in more than $70\\\\%$ accuracy for models larger than 1B. And for some larger PLMs, in-context learning with a few examples can also activate the ability. Then we consider the practical scenario where the models need to handle both FPQs and general questions. We demonstrate that a simple but effective data replay method can help mitigate the catastrophic forgetting of general questions, where the model discriminates $86.7\\\\%$ FPQs in FalseQA and only rebuts $1.4\\\\%$ general questions. These results lead to optimism that PLMs can be used as the backbones of a practical question-answering system that is robust to tricky questions.\"}\n{\"score\":28.2369,\"pdf_id\":\"529875d6-5189-5c4d-9076-1635a01a862d\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"1a79ff3d-ec2b-56ef-95df-f685b4e904d5\",\"text\":\"We frst train the PLMs to classify the question in FalseQA into FPQ and TPQ.
