{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In both corpora, a small number of tweets are labelled, each of which is annotated with a stance label (\\u2018pro-vaccine\\u2019, \\u2018anti-vaccine\\u2019 and \\u2018neutral\\u2019) and a text span or an argumentative pattern denoting an aspect. For example, for the tweet, \\u2018The Pfzer vaccine is safe.\\u2019, its stance label is \\u2018provaccine\\u2019 and the argumentative pattern is \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019. Since vaccination opinions explode over time, supervised classifers or aspect extractors would soon become outdated and fail to handle constantly evolving tweets. In an effort to mitigate this issue, we address the problem of vaccination opinion mining by learning disentangled stance and aspect vectors of tweets in order to cluster tweets along the aspect axis.\\n\\nOur proposed model, called Disentangled Opinion Clustering (DOC), is shown in Figure 1. It is trained in two steps. In unsupervised learning (Figure 1(a)), a tweet is fed into an autoencoder with DeBERTa as both the encoder and the decoder to learn the latent sentence vector $_{\\\\mathscr{z}}$ . Here, each tweet is mapped to two embeddings, the context embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ which encodes the stance label information and the aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ which captures the aspect information. Under unsupervised learning, these two embeddings are not distinguished. Together with the hidden representation of the input text, $H$ , they are mapped to the latent sentence vector $_{z}$ by cross-attention. As the autoencoder can be trained on a large-scale unannotated tweets relating to vaccination, it is expected that $_{\\\\mathscr{z}}$ would capture the vaccine-related topics.\\nThen in the second step of supervised learning (Figure 1(b)), the DeBERTa-based autoencoder is fne-tuned to learn the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ using the tweet-level annotated stance label and aspect text span (or the argumentative pattern \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019 in Figure 1(b)) as the inductive bias. Here, the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ is derived from $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ . It is expected that $z_{s}$ can be used to predict the stance label. On the other hand, the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ is derived from $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ only and it can be used to generate the SBERTencoded aspect text span. Both $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and $z_{a}$ , together with the hidden representation of the input text $H$ , are used to reconstruct the original text through the DeBERTa decoder. The training instances are organized in pairs since we use the idea of swapped autoencoder (shown in Figure 1(c)) to swap the aspect embedding of one tweet with that of another if both discuss the same aspect. The resulting latent vector can still be used to reconstruct the original tweet. In what follows, we describe the two steps, unsupervised and supervised learning, in detail.\\nUnsupervised Learning of Sentence Representation Due to the versatility of PLMs, sentence representations are usually derived directly from contextualised representations generated by the PLMs. However, as has been previously discussed in Montero et al. (2021), sentence representations derived in this way cannot guarantee reliable reconstruction of the input text. Partly inspired by the use of autoencoder for sentence representation learning as in (Montero et al., 2021), we adopt the autoencoder\\nFigure 1: Disentangled Opinion Clustering (DOC) Model. (a) Unsupervised learning. A tweet is fed into an autoencoder with DeBERTa as both the encoder and decoder to learn the latent sentence vector $_{z}$ ; (b) Supervised learning. The DeBERTa-based autoencoder is fne-tuned to learn the latent stance vector $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ using the tweet-level annotated stance label and aspect text span (or the argumentative pattern \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019 for the input tweet) as the inductive bias; (c) Swapping autoencoder. To enable a better disentanglement of $z_{s}$ and $z_{a}$ , for the two tweets discussing the same aspect but with different stance labels, tweet $B$ \\u2019s aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}^{B}$ is replaced by the tweet A\\u2019s aspect embedding ${\\\\pmb u}_{a}^{A}$ . As the two tweets discuss the same aspect, their aspect embeddings are expected to be similar. As such, we can still reconstruct tweet $B$ using the latent content vector $z_{c}^{B}$ derived from the swapped aspect embedding. Note that (b) and (c) are learned simultaneously.\\narchitecture to initially guide the sentence representation learning by fne-tuning it on vaccination tweets. Rather than RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we adopt DeBERTa, a variant of BERT in which each word is represented using two vectors encoding its content and position. The attention weight of a word pair is computed as a sum of four attention scores calculated from different directions based on their content\\/position vectors, i.e., content-tocontent, content-to-position, position-to-content, and position-to-position. Instead of representing each word by a content vector and a position vector, we modify DeBERTa by representing an input sentence using two vectors, a context embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and an aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information. We will discuss later in this section how to perform disentangled representation learning with $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ . During the unsupervised learning stage, we do not distinguish between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ and simply use $\\\\pmb{u}=[\\\\pmb{u}_{s},\\\\pmb{u}_{a}]$ to denote them.\\nMore specifcally, we train the autoencoder on an unannotated Twitter corpus with the masked token prediction as the training objective. The encoder applies the multi-head attention to clamp the hidden representations of the top layer of the pre-trained transformer. If we use $H$ to denote the hidden representations, the multi-head attention can be expressed as:\\nwhere $H\\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d_{H}}$ , $W_{Q}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{K}~\\\\in~$ $\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{V}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times\\\\dot{d_{V}}}$ , $\\\\mathrm{head}_{i}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{V}}$ and $W_{O}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{h d_{V}\\\\times d_{\\\\mathbf{z}}}$ . $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}}$ is generated from a fully-connected layer over the hidden vectors. The bottleneck representation $\\\\mathbf{z}$ is supposed to encode the semantics of the whole sentence.\\nThe transformer decoder comprises $n$ layers of cross-attention such that the output of the previous layer is processed by a gating mechanism (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The recurrence is repeated $n$ times to reconstruct the input, where $n$ denotes the token length of the input text.\\nInjecting Inductive Biases by Disentangled Attention Recent work on disentanglement learning suggested unsupervised disentanglement is impossible without inductive bias (Locatello et al., 2020b). In the datasets used in our experiments, there are a small number of labelled tweets. We can use the tweet-level stance labels and the annotated aspect text spans as inductive bias. Here, the disentangled attention of DeBERTa is utilized to mingle different factors. Assuming each sentence is mapped to two vectors, the context vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and the aspect vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information, we can then map $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ to a latent stance vector $z_{s}$ which can be used to predict the stance label, and map $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to a latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ which can be used to reconstruct the aspect text span. We use the cross-attention between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to reconstruct the original input sentence.\\n\\nStance Classifcation Let $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ denote the hidden representation of the [CLS] token, the stance bias is injected by classifcation over the stance categories:\\nEssentially, we use $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ as query and $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ as key and value to derive $z_{s}$ , which is subsequently fed to a softmax layer to predict a stance label $\\\\hat{y}_{s}$ . The objective function is a cross-entropy loss between the true and the predicted labels.\\nAspect Text Span Reconstruction We assume $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding the sentence-level aspect information and use self-attention to derive the latent aspect representation $z_{a}$ . To reconstruct the aspect text span from $z_{a}$ , we use the embedding generated by SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) as the targeted aspect span, since SBERT has been empirically shown achieving the state-of-the-art on Semantic Textual Similarity tasks. Those clusteringfriendly representations, if they encode the argumentative patterns or aspect spans alone, are strong inductive biases in the axis of aspects.\\nSpecifcally, the sentence embedding of the aspect expression is generated by a Gaussian MLP decoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014):\\nwhere $\\\\pmb{x}_{a}$ denotes the aspect text span in the original input sentence, $\\\\mathbf{y}_{a}$ is the ground-truth aspect text span embedding produced by $\\\\mathrm{~\\\\bf~y~}_{a}=$ $\\\\mathsf{S B E R T}(\\\\pmb{x}_{a})$ , whose value is used for computing the Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss2.\\nInput Text Reconstruction To reconstruct the original input text, we need to make use of both the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ . Here we use the cross attention of these two vectors to derive the content vector $z_{c}$ .\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\ =\\\\ [\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ , $a_{j}$ is the $j$ -th element of $\\\\textbf{\\\\em a}$ , and $K_{j}^{c}$ represents the $j$ -th row of $K_{c}$ . The resulting $\\\\mathbf{z}_{c}$ is the content representation for reconstructing the original sentence.\\nDisentanglement of Aspect and Stance Although the inductive biases, i.e., the tweet-level stance label and the annotated aspect span, are used to learn the latent stance vectors $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the aspect vectors $z_{a}$ , there could still be possible dependencies between the two latent variables. To further the disentanglement, we propose to swap the learned aspect embeddings of two tweets discussing the same aspect in Siamese networks. We draw inspiration from the Swapping Autoencoder (Park et al., 2020) where a constituent vector of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is swapped with that produced by another image. The original swapping autoencoder was designed for image editing and required a patch discriminator with texture cropping to the corresponding disentangled factors with the desired properties. In our scenario, such alignment is instead induced by tweets discussing the same aspect.\\nWe create pairs of tweets by permutations within the same aspect group $\\\\{\\\\pmb{x}^{A},\\\\pmb{x}^{B}\\\\}_{A,B\\\\in G_{k},A\\\\neq B}$ Here, by abuse of notation, we use $k$ to denote the $k$ -th aspect group, $G_{k}$ . The groups are identifed by tweets with the same aspect label, regardless of their stances. We sketch the structure of pair-wised training in Figure 1(c). The tweets are organized in pairs and a bottleneck representation is obtained for each tweet:\\nWe would like $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ to disentangle into latent factors, i.e., the variation in a factor of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ is associated with a change in $\\\\pmb{x}^{A}$ (Locatello et al., 2020a). Unlike the majority of works (Zhang et al., 2021d) that directly splits $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ in the latent space, we assume that the entangled vector is decomposed by a causal network. We train a vector $\\\\mathbf{u}=[\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ to trigger the activation of the networks (i.e., the self-attentions in Eq. 3-Eq. 7). The outputs of the networks are independent components that encode the desiderata. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}$ are parameterized independent components triggered by $\\\\mathbf{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}$ respectively, the substitution of $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ can be regarded as soft exchanges between ${\\\\bf z}_{a}^{A}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ .\\n\\nWe thus substitute $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ to cause changes in ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ . This substitution will also be refected by changes in $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ . In practice, we train on all permutations with the same aspect group, regardless of the stance. The reconstruction loss for each latent factor (i.e., stance and aspect) is calculated once to balance the number of training examples unless it is content text generated from the swapped bottleneck representation.\\nFormally, the swapping autoencoder presented in Figure 1(c) can be expressed as\\nTable 1: Dataset statistics of CMF and VAD. We list the number of pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and neutral tweets in each group.\\nwhere ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ is input to the decoder for the reconstruction of $x^{B}$ . Note that the above equations are specially used in the swapping autoencoder for the computation of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{B}$ . If there is no substitution in the latent space, the above equations will not be calculated.

In both corpora, a small number of tweets are labelled, each of which is annotated with a stance label (\\u2018pro-vaccine\\u2019, \\u2018anti-vaccine\\u2019 and \\u2018neutral\\u2019) and a text span or an argumentative pattern denoting an aspect. For example, for the tweet, \\u2018The Pfzer vaccine is safe.\\u2019, its stance label is \\u2018provaccine\\u2019 and the argumentative pattern is \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019. Since vaccination opinions explode over time, supervised classifers or aspect extractors would soon become outdated and fail to handle constantly evolving tweets. In an effort to mitigate this issue, we address the problem of vaccination opinion mining by learning disentangled stance and aspect vectors of tweets in order to cluster tweets along the aspect axis.\\n\\nOur proposed model, called Disentangled Opinion Clustering (DOC), is shown in Figure 1. It is trained in two steps. In unsupervised learning (Figure 1(a)), a tweet is fed into an autoencoder with DeBERTa as both the encoder and the decoder to learn the latent sentence vector $_{\\\\mathscr{z}}$ . Here, each tweet is mapped to two embeddings, the context embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ which encodes the stance label information and the aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ which captures the aspect information. Under unsupervised learning, these two embeddings are not distinguished. Together with the hidden representation of the input text, $H$ , they are mapped to the latent sentence vector $_{z}$ by cross-attention. As the autoencoder can be trained on a large-scale unannotated tweets relating to vaccination, it is expected that $_{\\\\mathscr{z}}$ would capture the vaccine-related topics.\\nThen in the second step of supervised learning (Figure 1(b)), the DeBERTa-based autoencoder is fne-tuned to learn the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ using the tweet-level annotated stance label and aspect text span (or the argumentative pattern \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019 in Figure 1(b)) as the inductive bias. Here, the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ is derived from $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ . It is expected that $z_{s}$ can be used to predict the stance label. On the other hand, the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ is derived from $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ only and it can be used to generate the SBERTencoded aspect text span. Both $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and $z_{a}$ , together with the hidden representation of the input text $H$ , are used to reconstruct the original text through the DeBERTa decoder. The training instances are organized in pairs since we use the idea of swapped autoencoder (shown in Figure 1(c)) to swap the aspect embedding of one tweet with that of another if both discuss the same aspect. The resulting latent vector can still be used to reconstruct the original tweet. In what follows, we describe the two steps, unsupervised and supervised learning, in detail.\\nUnsupervised Learning of Sentence Representation Due to the versatility of PLMs, sentence representations are usually derived directly from contextualised representations generated by the PLMs. However, as has been previously discussed in Montero et al. (2021), sentence representations derived in this way cannot guarantee reliable reconstruction of the input text. Partly inspired by the use of autoencoder for sentence representation learning as in (Montero et al., 2021), we adopt the autoencoder\\nFigure 1: Disentangled Opinion Clustering (DOC) Model. (a) Unsupervised learning. A tweet is fed into an autoencoder with DeBERTa as both the encoder and decoder to learn the latent sentence vector $_{z}$ ; (b) Supervised learning. The DeBERTa-based autoencoder is fne-tuned to learn the latent stance vector $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ using the tweet-level annotated stance label and aspect text span (or the argumentative pattern \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019 for the input tweet) as the inductive bias; (c) Swapping autoencoder. To enable a better disentanglement of $z_{s}$ and $z_{a}$ , for the two tweets discussing the same aspect but with different stance labels, tweet $B$ \\u2019s aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}^{B}$ is replaced by the tweet A\\u2019s aspect embedding ${\\\\pmb u}_{a}^{A}$ . As the two tweets discuss the same aspect, their aspect embeddings are expected to be similar. As such, we can still reconstruct tweet $B$ using the latent content vector $z_{c}^{B}$ derived from the swapped aspect embedding. Note that (b) and (c) are learned simultaneously.\\narchitecture to initially guide the sentence representation learning by fne-tuning it on vaccination tweets. Rather than RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we adopt DeBERTa, a variant of BERT in which each word is represented using two vectors encoding its content and position. The attention weight of a word pair is computed as a sum of four attention scores calculated from different directions based on their content\\/position vectors, i.e., content-tocontent, content-to-position, position-to-content, and position-to-position. Instead of representing each word by a content vector and a position vector, we modify DeBERTa by representing an input sentence using two vectors, a context embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and an aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information. We will discuss later in this section how to perform disentangled representation learning with $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ . During the unsupervised learning stage, we do not distinguish between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ and simply use $\\\\pmb{u}=[\\\\pmb{u}_{s},\\\\pmb{u}_{a}]$ to denote them.\\nMore specifcally, we train the autoencoder on an unannotated Twitter corpus with the masked token prediction as the training objective. The encoder applies the multi-head attention to clamp the hidden representations of the top layer of the pre-trained transformer. If we use $H$ to denote the hidden representations, the multi-head attention can be expressed as:\\nwhere $H\\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d_{H}}$ , $W_{Q}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{K}~\\\\in~$ $\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{V}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times\\\\dot{d_{V}}}$ , $\\\\mathrm{head}_{i}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{V}}$ and $W_{O}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{h d_{V}\\\\times d_{\\\\mathbf{z}}}$ . $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}}$ is generated from a fully-connected layer over the hidden vectors. The bottleneck representation $\\\\mathbf{z}$ is supposed to encode the semantics of the whole sentence.\\nThe transformer decoder comprises $n$ layers of cross-attention such that the output of the previous layer is processed by a gating mechanism (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The recurrence is repeated $n$ times to reconstruct the input, where $n$ denotes the token length of the input text.\\nInjecting Inductive Biases by Disentangled Attention Recent work on disentanglement learning suggested unsupervised disentanglement is impossible without inductive bias (Locatello et al., 2020b). In the datasets used in our experiments, there are a small number of labelled tweets. We can use the tweet-level stance labels and the annotated aspect text spans as inductive bias. Here, the disentangled attention of DeBERTa is utilized to mingle different factors. Assuming each sentence is mapped to two vectors, the context vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and the aspect vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information, we can then map $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ to a latent stance vector $z_{s}$ which can be used to predict the stance label, and map $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to a latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ which can be used to reconstruct the aspect text span. We use the cross-attention between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to reconstruct the original input sentence.\\n\\nStance Classifcation Let $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ denote the hidden representation of the [CLS] token, the stance bias is injected by classifcation over the stance categories:\\nEssentially, we use $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ as query and $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ as key and value to derive $z_{s}$ , which is subsequently fed to a softmax layer to predict a stance label $\\\\hat{y}_{s}$ . The objective function is a cross-entropy loss between the true and the predicted labels.\\nAspect Text Span Reconstruction We assume $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding the sentence-level aspect information and use self-attention to derive the latent aspect representation $z_{a}$ . To reconstruct the aspect text span from $z_{a}$ , we use the embedding generated by SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) as the targeted aspect span, since SBERT has been empirically shown achieving the state-of-the-art on Semantic Textual Similarity tasks. Those clusteringfriendly representations, if they encode the argumentative patterns or aspect spans alone, are strong inductive biases in the axis of aspects.\\nSpecifcally, the sentence embedding of the aspect expression is generated by a Gaussian MLP decoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014):\\nwhere $\\\\pmb{x}_{a}$ denotes the aspect text span in the original input sentence, $\\\\mathbf{y}_{a}$ is the ground-truth aspect text span embedding produced by $\\\\mathrm{~\\\\bf~y~}_{a}=$ $\\\\mathsf{S B E R T}(\\\\pmb{x}_{a})$ , whose value is used for computing the Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss2.\\nInput Text Reconstruction To reconstruct the original input text, we need to make use of both the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ . Here we use the cross attention of these two vectors to derive the content vector $z_{c}$ .\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\ =\\\\ [\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ , $a_{j}$ is the $j$ -th element of $\\\\textbf{\\\\em a}$ , and $K_{j}^{c}$ represents the $j$ -th row of $K_{c}$ . The resulting $\\\\mathbf{z}_{c}$ is the content representation for reconstructing the original sentence.\\nDisentanglement of Aspect and Stance Although the inductive biases, i.e., the tweet-level stance label and the annotated aspect span, are used to learn the latent stance vectors $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the aspect vectors $z_{a}$ , there could still be possible dependencies between the two latent variables. To further the disentanglement, we propose to swap the learned aspect embeddings of two tweets discussing the same aspect in Siamese networks. We draw inspiration from the Swapping Autoencoder (Park et al., 2020) where a constituent vector of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is swapped with that produced by another image. The original swapping autoencoder was designed for image editing and required a patch discriminator with texture cropping to the corresponding disentangled factors with the desired properties. In our scenario, such alignment is instead induced by tweets discussing the same aspect.\\nWe create pairs of tweets by permutations within the same aspect group $\\\\{\\\\pmb{x}^{A},\\\\pmb{x}^{B}\\\\}_{A,B\\\\in G_{k},A\\\\neq B}$ Here, by abuse of notation, we use $k$ to denote the $k$ -th aspect group, $G_{k}$ . The groups are identifed by tweets with the same aspect label, regardless of their stances. We sketch the structure of pair-wised training in Figure 1(c). The tweets are organized in pairs and a bottleneck representation is obtained for each tweet:\\nWe would like $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ to disentangle into latent factors, i.e., the variation in a factor of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ is associated with a change in $\\\\pmb{x}^{A}$ (Locatello et al., 2020a). Unlike the majority of works (Zhang et al., 2021d) that directly splits $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ in the latent space, we assume that the entangled vector is decomposed by a causal network. We train a vector $\\\\mathbf{u}=[\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ to trigger the activation of the networks (i.e., the self-attentions in Eq. 3-Eq. 7). The outputs of the networks are independent components that encode the desiderata. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}$ are parameterized independent components triggered by $\\\\mathbf{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}$ respectively, the substitution of $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ can be regarded as soft exchanges between ${\\\\bf z}_{a}^{A}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ .\\n\\nWe thus substitute $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ to cause changes in ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ . This substitution will also be refected by changes in $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ . In practice, we train on all permutations with the same aspect group, regardless of the stance. The reconstruction loss for each latent factor (i.e., stance and aspect) is calculated once to balance the number of training examples unless it is content text generated from the swapped bottleneck representation.\\nFormally, the swapping autoencoder presented in Figure 1(c) can be expressed as\\nTable 1: Dataset statistics of CMF and VAD. We list the number of pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and neutral tweets in each group.\\nwhere ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ is input to the decoder for the reconstruction of $x^{B}$ . Note that the above equations are specially used in the swapping autoencoder for the computation of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{B}$ . If there is no substitution in the latent space, the above equations will not be calculated. Given $\\\\mathcal{L}_{c}^{B}=\\\\mathrm{dec}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{c}^{B})$ , the fnal objective function is written as\\nwhere $\\\\lambda_{s},\\\\,\\\\lambda_{a}$ and $\\\\lambda_{B}$ are hyper-parameters controlling the importance of each desirable property. In our experiments, we choose $\\\\lambda_{s}=\\\\lambda_{a}=1$ and $\\\\lambda_{B}=0.5$ .\"}\n{\"score\":10.4625,\"pdf_id\":\"c51a33ed-cd35-5426-b37e-6864a1b66a35\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"d20ad06b-d44f-5e26-88b4-fd815ee42d51\",\"text\":\"\\u25a1\\u0013 A1.

(a) Unsupervised learning. A tweet is fed into an autoencoder with DeBERTa as both the encoder and decoder to learn the latent sentence vector $_{z}$ ; (b) Supervised learning. The DeBERTa-based autoencoder is fne-tuned to learn the latent stance vector $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ using the tweet-level annotated stance label and aspect text span (or the argumentative pattern \\u2018vaccine safety\\u2019 for the input tweet) as the inductive bias; (c) Swapping autoencoder. To enable a better disentanglement of $z_{s}$ and $z_{a}$ , for the two tweets discussing the same aspect but with different stance labels, tweet $B$ \\u2019s aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}^{B}$ is replaced by the tweet A\\u2019s aspect embedding ${\\\\pmb u}_{a}^{A}$ . As the two tweets discuss the same aspect, their aspect embeddings are expected to be similar. As such, we can still reconstruct tweet $B$ using the latent content vector $z_{c}^{B}$ derived from the swapped aspect embedding. Note that (b) and (c) are learned simultaneously.\\narchitecture to initially guide the sentence representation learning by fne-tuning it on vaccination tweets. Rather than RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we adopt DeBERTa, a variant of BERT in which each word is represented using two vectors encoding its content and position. The attention weight of a word pair is computed as a sum of four attention scores calculated from different directions based on their content\\/position vectors, i.e., content-tocontent, content-to-position, position-to-content, and position-to-position. Instead of representing each word by a content vector and a position vector, we modify DeBERTa by representing an input sentence using two vectors, a context embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and an aspect embedding $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information. We will discuss later in this section how to perform disentangled representation learning with $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ . During the unsupervised learning stage, we do not distinguish between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ and simply use $\\\\pmb{u}=[\\\\pmb{u}_{s},\\\\pmb{u}_{a}]$ to denote them.\\nMore specifcally, we train the autoencoder on an unannotated Twitter corpus with the masked token prediction as the training objective. The encoder applies the multi-head attention to clamp the hidden representations of the top layer of the pre-trained transformer. If we use $H$ to denote the hidden representations, the multi-head attention can be expressed as:\\nwhere $H\\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times d_{H}}$ , $W_{Q}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{K}~\\\\in~$ $\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times d_{K}}$ , $W_{V}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\in\\\\ \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{H}\\\\times\\\\dot{d_{V}}}$ , $\\\\mathrm{head}_{i}~\\\\in~\\\\mathbb{R}^{d_{V}}$ and $W_{O}\\\\,\\\\in\\\\,\\\\mathbb{R}^{h d_{V}\\\\times d_{\\\\mathbf{z}}}$ . $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{2d_{H}}$ is generated from a fully-connected layer over the hidden vectors. The bottleneck representation $\\\\mathbf{z}$ is supposed to encode the semantics of the whole sentence.\\nThe transformer decoder comprises $n$ layers of cross-attention such that the output of the previous layer is processed by a gating mechanism (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The recurrence is repeated $n$ times to reconstruct the input, where $n$ denotes the token length of the input text.\\nInjecting Inductive Biases by Disentangled Attention Recent work on disentanglement learning suggested unsupervised disentanglement is impossible without inductive bias (Locatello et al., 2020b). In the datasets used in our experiments, there are a small number of labelled tweets. We can use the tweet-level stance labels and the annotated aspect text spans as inductive bias. Here, the disentangled attention of DeBERTa is utilized to mingle different factors. Assuming each sentence is mapped to two vectors, the context vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ encoding its stance label information and the aspect vector $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding its aspect information, we can then map $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ to a latent stance vector $z_{s}$ which can be used to predict the stance label, and map $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to a latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ which can be used to reconstruct the aspect text span. We use the cross-attention between $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ to reconstruct the original input sentence.\\n\\nStance Classifcation Let $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ denote the hidden representation of the [CLS] token, the stance bias is injected by classifcation over the stance categories:\\nEssentially, we use $\\\\pmb{u}_{s}$ as query and $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\mathrm{CLS}}$ as key and value to derive $z_{s}$ , which is subsequently fed to a softmax layer to predict a stance label $\\\\hat{y}_{s}$ . The objective function is a cross-entropy loss between the true and the predicted labels.\\nAspect Text Span Reconstruction We assume $\\\\pmb{u}_{a}$ encoding the sentence-level aspect information and use self-attention to derive the latent aspect representation $z_{a}$ . To reconstruct the aspect text span from $z_{a}$ , we use the embedding generated by SBERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019) as the targeted aspect span, since SBERT has been empirically shown achieving the state-of-the-art on Semantic Textual Similarity tasks. Those clusteringfriendly representations, if they encode the argumentative patterns or aspect spans alone, are strong inductive biases in the axis of aspects.\\nSpecifcally, the sentence embedding of the aspect expression is generated by a Gaussian MLP decoder (Kingma and Welling, 2014):\\nwhere $\\\\pmb{x}_{a}$ denotes the aspect text span in the original input sentence, $\\\\mathbf{y}_{a}$ is the ground-truth aspect text span embedding produced by $\\\\mathrm{~\\\\bf~y~}_{a}=$ $\\\\mathsf{S B E R T}(\\\\pmb{x}_{a})$ , whose value is used for computing the Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss2.\\nInput Text Reconstruction To reconstruct the original input text, we need to make use of both the latent stance vector $z_{s}$ and the latent aspect vector $z_{a}$ . Here we use the cross attention of these two vectors to derive the content vector $z_{c}$ .\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\ =\\\\ [\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ , $a_{j}$ is the $j$ -th element of $\\\\textbf{\\\\em a}$ , and $K_{j}^{c}$ represents the $j$ -th row of $K_{c}$ . The resulting $\\\\mathbf{z}_{c}$ is the content representation for reconstructing the original sentence.\\nDisentanglement of Aspect and Stance Although the inductive biases, i.e., the tweet-level stance label and the annotated aspect span, are used to learn the latent stance vectors $\\\\mathit{\\\\Pi}_{z_{s}}$ and the aspect vectors $z_{a}$ , there could still be possible dependencies between the two latent variables. To further the disentanglement, we propose to swap the learned aspect embeddings of two tweets discussing the same aspect in Siamese networks. We draw inspiration from the Swapping Autoencoder (Park et al., 2020) where a constituent vector of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is swapped with that produced by another image. The original swapping autoencoder was designed for image editing and required a patch discriminator with texture cropping to the corresponding disentangled factors with the desired properties. In our scenario, such alignment is instead induced by tweets discussing the same aspect.\\nWe create pairs of tweets by permutations within the same aspect group $\\\\{\\\\pmb{x}^{A},\\\\pmb{x}^{B}\\\\}_{A,B\\\\in G_{k},A\\\\neq B}$ Here, by abuse of notation, we use $k$ to denote the $k$ -th aspect group, $G_{k}$ . The groups are identifed by tweets with the same aspect label, regardless of their stances. We sketch the structure of pair-wised training in Figure 1(c). The tweets are organized in pairs and a bottleneck representation is obtained for each tweet:\\nWe would like $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ to disentangle into latent factors, i.e., the variation in a factor of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ is associated with a change in $\\\\pmb{x}^{A}$ (Locatello et al., 2020a). Unlike the majority of works (Zhang et al., 2021d) that directly splits $\\\\mathbf{z}^{A}$ in the latent space, we assume that the entangled vector is decomposed by a causal network. We train a vector $\\\\mathbf{u}=[\\\\mathbf{u}_{s},\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}]$ to trigger the activation of the networks (i.e., the self-attentions in Eq. 3-Eq. 7). The outputs of the networks are independent components that encode the desiderata. If $\\\\mathbf{z}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}$ are parameterized independent components triggered by $\\\\mathbf{u}_{s}$ and $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}$ respectively, the substitution of $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ can be regarded as soft exchanges between ${\\\\bf z}_{a}^{A}$ and $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ .\\n\\nWe thus substitute $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{B}$ with $\\\\mathbf{u}_{a}^{A}$ to cause changes in ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ . This substitution will also be refected by changes in $\\\\mathbf{z}_{a}^{B}$ . In practice, we train on all permutations with the same aspect group, regardless of the stance. The reconstruction loss for each latent factor (i.e., stance and aspect) is calculated once to balance the number of training examples unless it is content text generated from the swapped bottleneck representation.\\nFormally, the swapping autoencoder presented in Figure 1(c) can be expressed as\\nTable 1: Dataset statistics of CMF and VAD. We list the number of pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and neutral tweets in each group.\\nwhere ${\\\\bf z}_{c}^{B}$ is input to the decoder for the reconstruction of $x^{B}$ . Note that the above equations are specially used in the swapping autoencoder for the computation of $\\\\mathbf{z}^{B}$ . If there is no substitution in the latent space, the above equations will not be calculated. Given $\\\\mathcal{L}_{c}^{B}=\\\\mathrm{dec}(\\\\mathbf{z}_{c}^{B})$ , the fnal objective function is written as\\nwhere $\\\\lambda_{s},\\\\,\\\\lambda_{a}$ and $\\\\lambda_{B}$ are hyper-parameters controlling the importance of each desirable property. In our experiments, we choose $\\\\lambda_{s}=\\\\lambda_{a}=1$ and $\\\\lambda_{B}=0.5$ .\"}\n{\"score\":14.3692,\"pdf_id\":\"c51a33ed-cd35-5426-b37e-6864a1b66a35\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"d20ad06b-d44f-5e26-88b4-fd815ee42d51\",\"text\":\"\\u25a1\\u0013 A1.

It can be observed that using the disentangled aspect vectors for clustering gives better results compared to using the content vectors, regardless of the clustering approaches used.
