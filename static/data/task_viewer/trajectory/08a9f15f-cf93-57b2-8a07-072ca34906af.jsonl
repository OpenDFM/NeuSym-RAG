{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

In each, we show that we can match Transformers\\nin quality using neither attention nor MLPs. We addition-\\nally evaluate wall-clock speedups against strong Trans-\\nformer baselines in the BERT setting. Additional exper-\\niments on speech and alternative architectures are given\\nin Appendix B, and experimental details are given in Ap-\\npendix C.\\n5.1\\nNon-Causal Language Modeling\\nWe introduce M2-BERT, an M2-based architecture for\\nnon-causal language modeling. M2-BERT acts as a drop-\\nin replacement for BERT-style language models [21],\\nwhich are a workhorse application of the Transformer\\narchitecture [1, 39, 40, 45, 48, 49, 52, 56, 85, 89]. We\\ntrain M2-BERT using masked language modeling over\\nC4 [66] with the bert-base-uncased tokenizer.\\nM2-BERT starts with a Transformer backbone and replaces the attention and MLPs with M2 layers,\\nshown in Figure 3. In the sequence mixer, we replace attention with bidirectional gated convolutions\\nwith a residual convolution (Figure 3 left). To recover convolutions, we set the Monarch matrices to\\nDFT and inverse DFT matrices. Following [27, 64], we also add short depthwise convolutions after\\nthe projections. In the dimension mixer, we replace the two dense matrices in MLPs with learned\\nblock-diagonal matrices (Monarch matrix of order 1, b = 4). We pretrain two M2-BERT-base models,\\nat 80M and 110M, and two M2-BERT-large models, at 260M and 341M. These are equivalent to\\nBERT-base and BERT-large, respectively.\\nDownstream GLUE Scores\\nFirst, we evaluate M2-BERT models on downstream \\ufb01ne-tuning\\ncompared to BERT-base and BERT-large from [20]. We take the pretrained models and \\ufb01ne-tune\\nthem on BERT, following the procedure in [38].

M2-BERT-large matches BERT-large with 24% fewer\\nparameters, and outperforms by 0.7 points when parameter matched.\\nGPU Throughput by Sequence Length\\nNext, we evaluate throughput of M2-BERT models\\nby sequence length, compared to HuggingFace implementations of BERT, as well as optimized\\nimplementations of BERT running FlashAttention [15]. Table 5 shows forward throughput for BERT-\\nbase equivalent models, and the appendix shows throughput for BERT-large (where the performance\\ntrends are similar). Inference times are reported in tokens\\/ms on an A100-40GB GPU. M2-BERT-\\nbase achieves higher throughput than even highly-optimized BERT models, and up to 9.1\\u00d7 faster\\nthroughput than a standard HuggingFace implementation at sequence length 4K.\\nCPU Inference Latency\\nFinally, we report CPU inference latency for M2-BERT-base (80M)\\ncompared to BERT-base, running direct PyTorch implementations for both. In short sequences, the\\nimpacts of data locality still dominate the FLOP reduction, and operations such as \\ufb01lter generation\\n(which are not present in BERT) pay a higher cost. Starting at sequences 1K and longer, M2-BERT-\\nbase starts to have speedup over BERT-base, up to 6.5\\u00d7 at sequence length 8K. We believe further\\noptimization and applying IO-aware principles can further improve CPU performance.\\n5.2\\nImage Classi\\ufb01cation\\nTo validate that our methods generalize to images as well as language for non-causal modeling, we\\nnext evaluate M2 on image classi\\ufb01cation. We compare M2 to ViT-style models and recent work,\\nHyenaViT-b [64], which uses gated long convolutions to replace the attention layers in ViT-b. In our\\nwork, M2-ViT builds off HyenaViT-b and replaces the long convolutions with the M2 operator in\\nEquation 2 (again setting the Monarch matrices to the DFT and inverse DFT). We replace the MLP\\nblocks in HyenaViT-b with block-diagonal matrices, similarly to M2-BERT. Appendix B additionally\\ncompares M2 to the Swin-family of architectures [50, 51].\\nTable 7 shows the performance of MONARCH MIXER against ViT-b, HyenaViT-b, and ViT-b-\\nMonarch (which replaces the MLP blocks of standard ViT-b with Monarch matrices) on ImageNet-1k.\\nMONARCH MIXER outperforms the other models with only half the parameters of the original ViT-s\\nmodel. Surprisingly, MONARCH MIXER also outperforms ResNet-152, with fewer parameters\\u2014even\\nthough the latter was explicitly designed for ImageNet performance.\\n5.3\\nCausal Language Modeling\\nGPT-style causal language modeling is a critical application for Transformers [6, 31, 43]. We\\nintroduce M2-GPT, a M2-based architecture for causal language modeling.

For example, a convolutional block with\\na sparse MLP can be expressed as follows:\\n1. Mix along sequence axis:\\n\\u02dc\\nX = M2(K1 \\u2299M1X)\\n(2)\\n2. Mix along embedding axis:\\nY\\u22a4= M4\\u03c3(M3 \\u02dc\\nX\\u22a4)\\n(3)\\nWhen M1 is set to the DFT and M2 is set to the inverse DFT, Equation 2 exactly corresponds\\nto a convolution with kernel K1 parameterized in frequency space. Equation 3 corresponds to an\\nMLP with the dense matrices replaced by Monarch matrices. More expressive layers are also easily\\nexpressible; for example, replacing Equation 2 with V \\u2299M2(K1 \\u2299M1(Q \\u2299K)), where Q, K, V\\nare linear projections of X, reproduces a gated convolution block, as in [27, 28, 64].\\nThe basic M2 layer is simple to implement; pseudocode is shown in Figure 1 (middle), and the\\nAppendix gives an ef\\ufb01cient implementation of M2 in under 40 lines of pure PyTorch (including\\nimports). The convolution case with Monarch matrices \\ufb01xed to DFT and inverse DFT matrices also\\nadmits implementations based on FFT algorithms [11].\\n3.3\\nArchitecture Benchmarks\\nWe benchmark the ef\\ufb01ciency of the M(K \\u2299MX) convolution operator (Equation 2) implemented in\\na simple CUDA kernel (calling standard cuBLAS sub-routines [61]), as the dimension N increases.\\nEquation 3 scales similarly, as dimension d increases. We keep the block size b \\ufb01xed to\\n\\u221a\\nN.\\nTable 2 shows the FLOP cost and utilization of a M2 operator as a function of the input size on an\\nA100 as well as on an RTX 4090. On the A100, the operator is more dominated by the data movement\\ncosts of the permutation operations (see the Appendix for a roo\\ufb02ine analysis). For longer inputs,\\nthe sub-quadratic scaling allows MONARCH MIXER to outperform dense matrix multiplication. On\\nthe RTX 4090, which has a larger and faster L2 cache than the A100, we can manually optimize an\\nimplementation to amortize data movement costs.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
