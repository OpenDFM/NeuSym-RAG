{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Since the focus of our work is to develop a model for detecting biographical events, WikiBio was used as development set for better monitoring its degree of compatibility with existing corpora. Following the approach by Joshi et al. (2020), we split each document into sequences of 128 tokens, and for each document we created one batch of variable length containing all the sequences. Table 4 shows the results of these experiments. As it can be observed, including the WikiBio corpus in the training set did not result in an increase of the performance of the model. This may be due to the low number of WikiBio documents in the training.The highest performance was obtained in two experiments: one using a training set only composed of documents from OntoNotes, which obtained a F-score of 0.808, and one with a miscellaneous of 50 OntoNotes and 50 GUM documents, that obtained 0.792. To understand if the difference between the two experiments is signifcant, we performed a One-Way ANOVA test over the train, development, and test F-scores obtained in both experiments.

The entity annotation subtask requires the identifcation of all mentions of a specifc Named Entity (NE) (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) of type Person, which is the target of the biography and all its coreferences (Deemter and Kibble, 2000) within the Wikipedia biography. For the modeling of this subtask, we used the GUM corpus (Zeldes, 2017), introducing different guidelines about the following aspects: i) only the mentions of the entity-target of the biography must be annotated; $i i$ ) mentions of the target entity must be selected only when they have a role in the event (Example 1, where the possessives \\u201chis\\u201d is not annotated); and iii) indirect mentions of the target entity must be annotated only if they are related to biographical events (Examples 2 and 3).\\n\\n1.

In 1985, the Biafran Civil War novel Sozaboy was published.\\nEvent Annotation. Although there is an intuitive understanding of how to identify event descriptions in natural language texts, there is quite a large variability in their realizations (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b). Araki et al. (2018) point out that some linguistic categories, e.g., nouns, fts on an event continuum. This makes the identifcation of event mentions a non trivial task. Our event annotation task mainly relies on TimeML (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a) and RED (O\\u2019Gorman et al., 2016), where \\u2018event\\u2019 is \\u201ca cover term for situations that happen or occur.\\u201d (Pustejovsky et al., 2003a)\\nEvents are annotated at a single token level with no restrictions on the parts of speech that realize the event. Following Bonial and Palmer (2016), we introduced a special tag (LINK) for marking a limited set of light and copular verbs, as illustrated in Example 4. The adoption of LINK is aimed at increasing the compatibility of the annotated corpus with OntoNotes, the resource with the highest number of annotated events.\\n4. Ken Saro-Wiwa <LINK $>$ was $<$ LINK $^{\\\\prime}>$ a Nigerian <EVENT $>$ writer $<$ <EVENT\\/> <LINK source $=$ \\u2018be\\u2019 target $=^{\\\\star}$ writer\\u2019 \\/>.\\nLastly, to enable automatic reasoning on biographies, we annotate the contextual modality of events (O\\u2019Gorman et al., 2016). In particular, to account for the uncertainty\\/hedged modality, i.e., any lexical item that expresses \\u201csome degree of uncertainty about the reality of the target event\\u201d (O\\u2019Gorman et al., 2016), we have defned three uncertainty values: INTENTION, for marking all the events expressing an intention (like \\u2018try\\u2019 or \\u2018attempt\\u2019); NOT_HAPPENED, for marking all events that have not occured; EPISTEMIC, which covers all the other types of uncertainty (e.g., opinion, conditional). The uncertainty status of the events is annotated by linking the contextual modality marker and the target event, as illustrated in Example 5:\\n\\n5. Feeling alienated, he decided to quit college, but was stopped [...]\\n<CONT_MOD source ${\\\\mathit{\\\\Gamma}}={\\\\mathit{\\\\check{\\\\Psi}}}$ decided\\u2019 target $=$ quit\\u2019 value ${\\\\mathit{\\\\Gamma}}={\\\\mathit{\\\\check{\\\\Psi}}}$ INTENTION\\u2019 \\/ > <CONT_MOD source ${\\\\mathit{\\\\Gamma}}={\\\\mathit{\\\\check{\\\\Psi}}}$ stopped\\u2019 target $=$ \\u2019quit\\u2019 value ${\\\\mathit{\\\\Gamma}}={\\\\mathit{\\\\check{\\\\Psi}}}$ NOT_HAPPENED\\u2019 \\/ >\\nCorpus Annotation and IAA. The annotation task was performed by three expert annotators (two men and one woman - all authors of the paper), near-native speakers of British English, having a long experience in annotating data for the specifc task (event and entity detection). One annotator (A0) was in charge of preparing the data by discarding all non-relevant sentences to speed-up the annotation process. This resulted in a fnal set of $1,691$ sentences containing at least one mention of a target entity. The entity and event annotations were conducted as follows: A0 annotated the entire relevant sentences, while a subset of 400 sentences was annotated by A1 and A2, who respectively labeled 200 sentences each. We report pair-wise Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA) using Cohen\\u2019s kappa in Table 1. In general, there is a fair agreement across all the annotation layers. At the same time, we observe a peculiar behavior across the annotators: there is a higher agreement between A0 and A2 for the event and entity layers when compared to A0 and A1, but the opposite occurs with the relations layers (LINK and CONT_MOD).\\nFor the events, the higher disagreement is due to nominal events, often misinterpreted as not bearing an eventive meaning. For instance, the noun \\u201ctrip\\u201d in example 6 was not annotated by A1.\\n6. When Ng\\u02dcug\\u02dc\\u0131 returned to America at the end of his month trip [...]\\nFor the entities, we observed that disagreement is due to two reasons. The frst is the consequence of a disagreement in the event annotations. Whenever annotators disagree on the identifcation of an event, they also disagree on the annotation of the related entity mention, as in the case of the pronoun \\u2018his\\u2019 in example 6. Another reason of disagreement regards indirect mentions. Annotators often disagree on annotation spans, as in \\u201cBiafran Civil War novel Sozaboy was published\\u201d where A1 selected \\u2018SozaBoy\\u2019, while A2 \\u2018novel Sozaboy\\u2019. When it comes to LINK, problems are mainly due to the identifcation of light verbs. Despite the decision of considering only a close set of copular and light verbs to be marked as LINK (Cfr Bonial and Palmer (2016)), annotators used this label for other verbs, such as \\u2018begin\\u2019 or \\u2018hold\\u2019.\\n7.

Among them, only 1, 691 sentences include at least one event related to the entity target of the biography. More specifcally, there are 3, 290 annotated events, 2, 985 mentions of a target entity, 343 LINK tags, and 75 CONT_MOD links.\\nCorpora size and genres We compare WikiBio against fve relevant existing corpora that, in principle, could be used to train models for biographical event detection: GUM (Zeldes, 2017), Litbank (Sims et al., 2019), Newsreader (Minard et al., 2016), OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006), and TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b). For each corpus, we took into account the number of relevant annotations and the types of texts. As it can be observed in Table 2, corpora vary in size and genres. OntoNotes is the biggest one and includes 159, 938 events, and 22, 234 entity mentions. The smaller is NewsReader, with only 594 annotated events. TimeBank and LitBank are similar in scope, since they both include about $7.5K$ events, while GUM includes 9, 762 entity mentions.\\nText types With the exception of GUM, which includes 20 biographies out of 175 documents, all other corpora contains types of texts other than biographies such as news, literary works, and transcription of TV news. To get a high-level picture of the potential similarities and differences in terms of probability distributions, we calculated the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (Men\\u00e9ndez et al., 1997). Such metric may be useful for identifying which corpora are most similar to WikiBio. The results show that WikiBio converges more with GUM (0.43), OntoNotes (0.48) and LitBank (0.49) rather than with TimeBank (0.51) and Newsreader (0.54). Such differences have driven the selection of data for the training set described in Section 3.2.\\n\\nAnnotations of entities, events, and coreference The distribution of the target entity within biographies in the WikiBio corpus has been compared with two annotated corpora for coreference resolution and named entity recognition: OntoNotes (Hovy et al., 2006) and GUM (Zeldes, 2017). Since such corpora were developed for identifying the coreferences of all NEs in a document, we modifed annotations to keep only the most frequent NEs of type \\u2018person\\u2019 in each document. The rationale was making these resources comparable with WikiBio, which includes only the coreferences to a single entity, namely the subject of each biography. After doing that, we computed the ratio between the number of tokens that mention the target entity and the total number of tokens, and the ratio between the number of sentences where the target entity is mentioned against the total number of sentences. While this operation did not impact on GUM, in which 174 out of 175 documents contain mentions of people, it had an important impact on OntoNotes, in which 1, 094 documents $(40\\\\%)$ do not mention entities of the type Person.\\nTokens mentioning the target entity are $5\\\\%$ on OntoNotes, $8.7\\\\%$ on GUM and $4\\\\%$ on WikiBio. Such differences can be explained by the average length of documents in these corpora, which is of 388 tokens in OntoNotes, 978 in GUM, and 3, 754 in WikiBio. As a matter of fact, if the percentage of sentences mentioning the target-entity is considered instead of the total number of tokens, WikiBio shows an higher ratio $(61.7\\\\%)$ of sentences mentioning the target entity, than OntoNotes $(20.8\\\\%)$ and GUM $(42.6\\\\%)$ .\\n\\nThe three most frequently occurring lemmas in the WikiBio corpus seem to be strongly related to the considered domain: \\u2018write\\u2019 represents $3.2\\\\%$ of the total, \\u2018publish\\u2019 $2.9\\\\%$ , and \\u2018work\\u2019 $1.8\\\\%$ . \\u2018Return\\u2019 $(1.3\\\\%)$ appears to have a more general scope, since it highlights a movement of the target entity from a place to another. The comparison with other corpora annotated for event detection shows differences concerning the most frequent events. The top three in OntoNotes (Bonial et al., 2010) are three light verbs: \\u2018be\\u2019, \\u2018have\\u2019, and \\u2018do\\u2019. This may be intrinsically linked to its annotation scheme which considers all verbs as candidates for being events, including semantically empty ones (Section 2.1). NewsReader (Minard et al., 2016) and TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003b) include two verbs expressing reporting actions among the top fve, thus revealing that they are corpora of annotated news. Litbank (Sims et al., 2019), which is a corpus of 100 annotated novels, includes in its top-ranked events two visual perception verbs and two verbs of movement, which may reveal the centrality of characters in this documents. The event \\u2018say\\u2019 is top-ranked in all the fve corpora.\"}\n{\"score\":9.1011,\"pdf_id\":\"30aea0d7-d2e5-58e4-ada8-4f4bf479edd9\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"96df2c9f-56b9-5e6d-a6bb-de1879620e12\",\"text\":\"\\u25a1\\u0013 A1.
