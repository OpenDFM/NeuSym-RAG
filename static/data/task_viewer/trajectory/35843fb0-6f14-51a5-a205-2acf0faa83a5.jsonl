{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Recently, Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) have shown success in code analysis and synthesis. In\\nthis paper, we present a combination of LLMs and static anal-\\nysis to synthesize invariants, assertions, and other proof struc-\\ntures for a Rust-based formal verification framework called\\nVerus. In a few-shot setting, LLMs demonstrate impressive\\nlogical ability in generating postconditions and loop invari-\\nants, especially when analyzing short code snippets. However,\\nLLMs lack the ability to retain and propagate context informa-\\ntion, a strength of traditional static analysis. Based on these\\nobservations, we developed a prototype based on OpenAI\\u2019s\\nGPT-4 model. Our prototype decomposes the verification task\\ninto multiple smaller ones, iteratively queries GPT-4, and com-\\nbines its output with lightweight static analysis. We evaluated\\nthe prototype with a developer in the automation loop on 20\\nvector-manipulating programs. The results demonstrate that\\nit significantly reduces human effort in writing entry-level\\nproof code.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nInteractive formal verification addresses complex verification\\ntasks that are beyond the capabilities of push-button verifica-\\ntion. However, using interactive formal verification is more\\nchallenging because it demands significant manual effort and\\nspecialized knowledge, especially when automatic verifica-\\ntion fails. Notably, the lines of code (LoC) required for verifi-\\ncation can potentially expand to as many as ten times the size\\nof the original code ( [11,12]).\\nInspired by recent advancements in Large Language Mod-\\nels (LLMs), we perceive an opportunity to reduce manual\\nefforts required for interactive formal verification. We have\\ndeveloped a prototype that leverages OpenAI\\u2019s GPT-4 [19]\\n\\u2217This work was done during an internship at Microsoft Research.\\nto automate proof writing. This prototype specializes in pro-\\ngrams that operate on vectors. Leveraging GPT-4\\u2019s capabil-\\nities in logical thinking and code understanding, we aim to\\nexpedite the development of entry-level programs, particu-\\nlarly those implementing well-known algorithms (e.g., sort,\\nreverse).\\nNevertheless, we have encountered two major challenges.\\nThe first challenge is that GPT-4 does not strictly follow cer-\\ntain properties and proofs from earlier contexts of a program.\\nThe second issue is that when an initial proof attempt fails\\nfor a lengthy program, GPT-4 becomes overwhelmed by the\\nmultitude of error messages, hindering its ability to improve\\nthe quality of proof.\\nTo address these challenges, we divide a program into\\nsmaller segments, and then utilize GPT-4 to generate the\\npre\\/post-conditions for each segment. Subsequently, we ask\\nGPT-4 to prove each segment individually. This strategy al-\\nlows GPT-4 to concentrate on a smaller segment of the pro-\\ngram per query. When GPT-4 generates a proof, our tool\\nextends it with a lightweight static analysis, which helps to\\npropagate the properties deduced from earlier sections of the\\nprogram throughout the analysis process. We evaluate our\\nprototype on 20 vector-manipulating programs. For these\\nentry-level programs, our prototype tool reduces the LoC for\\nproof by over 80%.\\n2\\nRelated work\\nThere have long been efforts to automate various aspects\\nof the verification pipeline, from automated invariant infer-\\nence to tactic-based proof generation [4, 5, 7, 26]. Invariant\\ninference has been used to prove properties of loops [6,8,9,\\n20, 22\\u201324], inductive algebraic data types [14, 18], and dis-\\ntributed protocols [10,13,17,21,27]. Among these lines of\\nresearch, a growing number of methods are based on neural\\nnetworks [7,22\\u201324, 26], which has gained traction for veri-\\nfication tasks in recent years and has been shown to better\\ntackle the search space explosion problem that has long hin-\\ndered the scalability of traditional methods.

Our work demonstrates that future\\nverification tools can be more efficient without sacrificing\\ntheir usability with the help of LLMs.\\n3\\nBackground\\nWe choose Verus [15] as the base verification tool in our\\nwork. Verus is a state-of-the-art verification tool for Rust that\\naggressively prunes the SMT context to optimize solving\\ntime. Although it can verify large and complicated systems\\nmore efficiently, it demands significantly more effort to write\\nproof code. To mitigate this, we consider several difficulties\\nfaced by Verus developers. First, like many other verification\\nlanguages, constructing deductive invariants is hard due to\\nthe large search space. Second, since Verus is very new to\\ndevelopers, it does not provide a large selection of reusable\\nproofs\\/lemmas or verified libraries. This requires developers\\nto have an understanding of logic and the ability to write\\nproofs, even for basic algorithms. Third, Verus encodes each\\nmodule and even each loop independently to facilitate fast\\nsolving. This optimization necessitates increased effort in\\nannotating the pre\\/post-conditions and invariants compared\\nto other verification languages (e.g., Dafny [16] or F* [25]).\\n4\\nMethodology\\n4.1\\nThe need of auto-generated invariants\\nConsider a simple Rust program that reverses a vector,\\nas shown in Figure 1. The developer needs to verify two\\npostconditions specified at Lines 2-5. The first postcondition\\nstates that the reversed vector should maintain the same length\\nas the original vector, and the second postcondition states that\\nthe i-th element of the reversed vector should be equal to\\nthe (length\\u2212i\\u22121)-th element in the original vector. These\\npostconditions define the correctness of the code. To prove the\\nloop with Verus [1], the developer needs to add the following\\nloop invariants.\\n1\\ninvariant\\n2\\n0 <= n <= l e n g t h\\n\\/\\n2 ,\\n3\\nv . len ( )\\n== length ,\\n4\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\n0 <= i < n ==> v [ i ] ==\\nold ( v ) [ l e n g t h \\u2212i \\u22121] ,\\n5\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\nl e n g t h \\u2212n <= i < l e n g t h\\n==> v [ i ] == old ( v ) [ l e n g t h \\u2212i \\u22121] ,\\n6\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\nn <= i < l e n g t h \\u2212n ==> v\\n[ i ] == old ( v ) [ i ] ,\\nLoop invariants define the conditions that remain true be-\\nfore and after each iteration of the loop, and they should be\\ninductive. The first invariant is straightforward; it defines\\nthe conditions for the termination of the loop. The second\\ninvariant is necessitated by Verus, as it performs separate ver-\\nifications for the loop and the other remaining parts of the\\nprogram.\\nThe third and fourth invariants specify the updates for any\\nmodified elements in the vector, within the range 0 \\u2264i < n\\nand length\\u2212n \\u2264i < length. The final invariant asserts that\\nevery element that has not been updated retains its initial\\nvalue, ensuring that the invariants for updated elements are\\ninductive. The absence of any one of these invariants will lead\\nto the failure of establishing the inductive invariants.\\nTo automatically fill these invariants (and potentially other\\nproof structures), we unleash the power of large language\\nmodels in the workflow depicted in Figure 2. Given the source\\ncode to be verified, we encode it into a prompt with a few shot\\nexamples and send the prompt to GPT-4. Each example is a\\npair of source code with to-be-proved properties (denoted as\\nsource_code) and verified code with human-provided proofs\\n(denoted as code_with_proof). When GPT-4 returns the code\\nwith proof, we validate it by using Verus to verify it.\\nMost of the time, GPT-4 cannot solve the problem with\\na single query. If verification with the generated proof fails,\\nwe follow a standard approach in LLM chain-based solutions\\nto integrate both the last response and the error message to\\nformulate a new prompt. This new query is then sent back to\\nGPT-4 for generating an improved result.\\nFor the example in Figure 1, GPT-4 successfully generates\\nthe first four invariants but misses the last one. In fact, human\\ndevelopers often make the same mistake \\u2014 forgetting to\\nspecify things that do not change. Verus then outputs three\\nerrors: the third and fourth invariants do not hold at the end of\\nthe loop body, and the postcondition on Line 5 does not hold.\\nAfter incorporating the error message into the second query,\\nGPT-4 returns all 5 invariants, making the code verifiable by\\nVerus. Ideally, if a human can quickly adjust the proof based\\non the hints provided by the error messages, we anticipate\\nthat GPT-4 can amend the proof in a similar manner.\\n2\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"Figure 2: Basic workflow of our tool.\\n4.2\\nTask decomposition for large programs\\nThe basic solution described in the previous section is only\\neffective for small programs. We have observed that GPT-\\n4 does not perform well for relatively large programs. It is\\nnot entirely surprising, given that we are asking GPT-4 to\\ngenerate a complete proof for the entire program, whereas\\nhuman developers typically think in small steps.\\nConsider the function in Figure 3. A human developer\\nwould initially prove the property of the vector following the\\nfirst loop, asserting that no element exceeds a value of two.\\nSubsequently, they would shift their focus to the second loop,\\nanalyzing its computation of a sum that does not exceed twice\\nthe number of elements.\\nWe can guide GPT-4 to think similarly by decomposing the\\nlarge code task into smaller ones. Given a code, we decom-\\npose it into smaller segments. For each segment, we define\\ntwo types of prompts. One is to let GPT-4 generate the re-\\nlationship between segments, where the post-condition of a\\nsegment must be a pre-condition of the next segment. The\\nother is to let GPT-4 generate the proof per segment.\\nFor the code in Figure 3, we can divide it at Line 13 into\\ntwo segments and query GPT-4 for the postcondition of the\\nfirst segment. For example, GPT-4 gives the following post-\\ncondition.\\n1\\ni == N,\\n2\\na . len ( )\\n== N,\\n3\\nf o r a l l\\n| k : i n t |\\n0 <= k < a . len ( )\\n==> a [ k ] <= 2 ,\\nWith the postcondition, the verification of the original code\\nis decomposed into two smaller tasks, each concerning one\\nof the two segments. For each segment, we use the workflow\\ndepicted in Figure 2 to complete the proof. The three-line\\ninterface above will serve as the postcondition when verifying\\nthe first segment and as the precondition when verifying the\\nsecond segment.\\n4.3\\nCombining GPT-4 with static analysis and\\nhuman\\nAlthough GPT-4 can generate logical formulas based on code,\\nincluding complicated quantified invariants, they often over-\\n1\\npub fn\\nfoo ( a : &mut Vec<u32 > , N:\\nu32 )\\n2\\nrequires\\n3\\nold ( a ) . len ( )\\n== N,\\n4\\nN <= 0x7FFF_FFFF ,\\n5\\n{\\n6\\nl e t\\nmut i :\\nusize = 0;\\n7\\nwhile\\n( i < N as\\nusize )\\n8\\n{\\n9\\ni f\\n( a [ i ] > 2) {\\n10\\na . s e t ( i ,\\n2) ;\\n11\\n}\\n12\\ni = i + 1;\\n13\\n}\\n14\\ni = 0;\\n15\\nl e t\\nmut sum :\\nu32 = 0;\\n16\\nwhile\\n( i < N as\\nusize )\\n17\\n{\\n18\\nsum = sum + a [ i ] ;\\n19\\ni = i + 1;\\n20\\n}\\n21\\na s s e r t ( sum <= 2 * N) ;\\n22\\n}\\nFigure 3: Verus function that sums over a vector after elements are\\ncapped at 2. requires specifies the precondition of the function.\\nlook certain non-intuitive simple invariants, much like begin-\\nner human developers.\\nFor example, one might find the upper bound of N in Line 4\\nconfusing.

To mitigate this, we consider several difficulties\\nfaced by Verus developers. First, like many other verification\\nlanguages, constructing deductive invariants is hard due to\\nthe large search space. Second, since Verus is very new to\\ndevelopers, it does not provide a large selection of reusable\\nproofs\\/lemmas or verified libraries. This requires developers\\nto have an understanding of logic and the ability to write\\nproofs, even for basic algorithms. Third, Verus encodes each\\nmodule and even each loop independently to facilitate fast\\nsolving. This optimization necessitates increased effort in\\nannotating the pre\\/post-conditions and invariants compared\\nto other verification languages (e.g., Dafny [16] or F* [25]).\\n4\\nMethodology\\n4.1\\nThe need of auto-generated invariants\\nConsider a simple Rust program that reverses a vector,\\nas shown in Figure 1. The developer needs to verify two\\npostconditions specified at Lines 2-5. The first postcondition\\nstates that the reversed vector should maintain the same length\\nas the original vector, and the second postcondition states that\\nthe i-th element of the reversed vector should be equal to\\nthe (length\\u2212i\\u22121)-th element in the original vector. These\\npostconditions define the correctness of the code. To prove the\\nloop with Verus [1], the developer needs to add the following\\nloop invariants.\\n1\\ninvariant\\n2\\n0 <= n <= l e n g t h\\n\\/\\n2 ,\\n3\\nv . len ( )\\n== length ,\\n4\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\n0 <= i < n ==> v [ i ] ==\\nold ( v ) [ l e n g t h \\u2212i \\u22121] ,\\n5\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\nl e n g t h \\u2212n <= i < l e n g t h\\n==> v [ i ] == old ( v ) [ l e n g t h \\u2212i \\u22121] ,\\n6\\nf o r a l l | i :\\ni n t |\\nn <= i < l e n g t h \\u2212n ==> v\\n[ i ] == old ( v ) [ i ] ,\\nLoop invariants define the conditions that remain true be-\\nfore and after each iteration of the loop, and they should be\\ninductive. The first invariant is straightforward; it defines\\nthe conditions for the termination of the loop. The second\\ninvariant is necessitated by Verus, as it performs separate ver-\\nifications for the loop and the other remaining parts of the\\nprogram.\\nThe third and fourth invariants specify the updates for any\\nmodified elements in the vector, within the range 0 \\u2264i < n\\nand length\\u2212n \\u2264i < length. The final invariant asserts that\\nevery element that has not been updated retains its initial\\nvalue, ensuring that the invariants for updated elements are\\ninductive. The absence of any one of these invariants will lead\\nto the failure of establishing the inductive invariants.\\nTo automatically fill these invariants (and potentially other\\nproof structures), we unleash the power of large language\\nmodels in the workflow depicted in Figure 2. Given the source\\ncode to be verified, we encode it into a prompt with a few shot\\nexamples and send the prompt to GPT-4. Each example is a\\npair of source code with to-be-proved properties (denoted as\\nsource_code) and verified code with human-provided proofs\\n(denoted as code_with_proof). When GPT-4 returns the code\\nwith proof, we validate it by using Verus to verify it.\\nMost of the time, GPT-4 cannot solve the problem with\\na single query. If verification with the generated proof fails,\\nwe follow a standard approach in LLM chain-based solutions\\nto integrate both the last response and the error message to\\nformulate a new prompt. This new query is then sent back to\\nGPT-4 for generating an improved result.\\nFor the example in Figure 1, GPT-4 successfully generates\\nthe first four invariants but misses the last one. In fact, human\\ndevelopers often make the same mistake \\u2014 forgetting to\\nspecify things that do not change. Verus then outputs three\\nerrors: the third and fourth invariants do not hold at the end of\\nthe loop body, and the postcondition on Line 5 does not hold.\\nAfter incorporating the error message into the second query,\\nGPT-4 returns all 5 invariants, making the code verifiable by\\nVerus. Ideally, if a human can quickly adjust the proof based\\non the hints provided by the error messages, we anticipate\\nthat GPT-4 can amend the proof in a similar manner.\\n2\\n1\\nfn\\nr e v e r s e ( v : &mut Vec<u64 >)\\n2\\nensures\\n3\\nv . len ( )\\n== old ( v ) . len ( ) ,\\n4\\nf o r a l l | i : i n t |\\n0 <= i < old ( v ) . len ( ) ==>\\n5\\nv [ i ] == old ( v ) [ old ( v ) . len ( )\\n\\u2212i\\n\\u22121]\\n6\\n{\\n7\\nl e t\\nl e n g t h = v . len ( ) ;\\n8\\nl e t\\nmut n :\\nusize = 0;\\n9\\nwhile n < l e n g t h\\n\\/\\n2\\n10\\n{\\n11\\nl e t\\nx = v [ n ] ;\\n12\\nl e t\\ny = v [ l e n g t h \\u22121 \\u2212n ] ;\\n13\\nv . s e t ( n ,\\ny ) ;\\n14\\nv . s e t ( l e n g t h \\u22121 \\u2212n ,\\nx ) ;\\n15\\nn = n + 1;\\n16\\n}\\n17\\n}\\nFigure 1: Function to reverse a vector. ensures specifies the post-\\ncondition of the function. old(v) means the value of v before the\\nfunction executes.\\nthose works, we apply an LLM to synthesize invariants and\\nintermediate assertions.
