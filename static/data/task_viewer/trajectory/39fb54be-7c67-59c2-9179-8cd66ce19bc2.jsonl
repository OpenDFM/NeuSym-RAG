{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

These selected agents cover mainstream agentbuilding approaches, including function calls, expert knowledge, and multi-agent communications. For fair comparisons, we use GPT-3.5 (v1106) with a temperature of 0 as backend LLMs for all agents.\\nThe key observations from Table 2 are as follows: (i) Chapyter is the worst-performing agent, but its pass rate signifcantly improves when presentation errors are ignored. (ii) CoML is the best for most benchmarks, except for LeetCode, where Jupyter-AI outperforms greatly.

Our goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques under data science scenarios.\\nChain-of-thought. CoT (Wei et al., 2022) is a popular method for generating prompts that can handle various tasks. However, as shown in Table 8, CoT does not perform well on DSEval benchmarks as expected. A possible explanation is that the code itself already has a logical structure and does not require additional chain-of-thoughts. This result is consistent with recent works such as SCoT (Li et al., 2023b), which introduces CoT variants for code generation tasks. However, since most data science code lacks the \\u201cstructure\\u201d of loops and conditions, adapting the method is challenging and we leave it as future work.\\nFew-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting (Kaplan et al., 2020) is a method that uses demonstrations in prompts to help the model learn from the context. CoML uses a 5-shot prompt (5 demonstrations) by default to improve the quality of its generation. Few-shot prompting has the drawback of using more tokens (around 1k for 5 demonstrations). We want to see what happens when we use less demonstrations in the prompt.\\nIn Figure 15a, we use a simple strategy, that is to keep the frst $k$ demonstrations in the order of appearance, where $k$ is the number of demonstrations to keep. We ran the experiment with different backend LLMs, including two versions of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro. The results show that the performance tends to get better with more shots (i.e., demonstrations). But there are also some exceptions. For instance, the pass rate of GPT-3.5 keeps going down on DSEval-LeetCode. On DSEval-Kaggle, the pass rate also fuctuates and the zero-shot performance is not worse than more shots.\\nWe hypothesize that this phenomenon is because of a misalignment between the demonstrations and the benchmarks. The demonstrations in CoML are made with toy datasets and problems, which might not match the problems in each benchmark. In Figure 15b, we manually created two more sets of demonstrations. One is from real-world situations such as data processing and model training. The other is from interview questions, from platforms like LeetCode. We made sure that the demonstrations did not overlap with any problem in the benchmarks. As shown in Figure 15b, with demonstrations from interviews, DSEval-LeetCode benefts a lot from demonstrations. However, this set of demonstrations does not work well for other benchmarks. Demonstrations from real-world have an unstable performance and generally not satisfactory, implying that choosing the right demonstrations is a challenging issue in this scenario.\\nReranking. Another well-known technique that is often used in conjunction with few-shot prompting is reordering the demonstrations (Liu et al., 2022; Nori et al., 2023), which is also known as \\u201csimilaritybased example selector\\u201d or \\u201ckNN-curated dynamic few-shot exemplar\\u201d. In our setting, we reorder the demonstrations by their cosine similarity (on \\u201ctext-embedding-ada- $.002^{\\\\circ}$ ) with the incoming query at inference time, and select the top $k$ demonstrations as the $k$ shots. The outcomes are presented in Figure 15c. Reordering the demonstrations is generally helpful for the performance, but the improvement is marginal. The performance is still much lower than a more powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4).\"}\n{\"score\":22.6731,\"pdf_id\":\"0fe6d2d4-00e7-596b-a80c-ffe5a6d88b97\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"38883559-8114-5f58-b936-60f203e85806\",\"text\":\"Based on DSEval, we employed the annotation process to construct four benchmarks, detailed in Table 1. These benchmarks encompass problem sets with diverse properties, ranging from straightforward tasks to more intricate challenges. More technical details about how we created those benchmarks are available in Appendix F.\\nValidator Usages. Our evaluation process encompasses the entire lifecycle of data science agents. We employ a total of nine validators, each targeting distinct facets within the lifecycle. Details regarding their utilization are documented in Section B. Within our benchmarks, data science agents undergo validation through 6.5 validators per problem on average.\\nProblem diffculty. For a better understanding of the performance across different diffculty levels, similar to previous studies (Yu et al., 2018), we quantify code complexity by considering the number of function calls, expressions, conditions, and loops in the reference code for each problem. The distribution of problem diffculties is depicted in Figure 7, with the average diffculty detailed in Table 1. We observe that DSEval-LeetCode poses the highest level of diffculty, while DSEval-Kaggle exhibits the most diverse range of diffculty levels.\\nFigure 8: API coverage and dependency graph example.\\nAPI coverage. Collectively, the four benchmarks covered 2240 API calls spanning 448 distinct APIs within the oracle code. These APIs are visualized in Figure 8a. Unsurprisingly, the most frequently utilized libraries are pandas, sklearn, and numpy. In total, 12 libraries are covered, with imblearn, nltk, statsmodels, and catboost being the least frequently employed. The most commonly occurring API is the [] operation of DataFrame, utilized for selecting indexes or columns.\\nKnowledge points coverage. We use GPT-3.5 to summarize the data science knowledge points essential for solving each problem. As illustrated in the word cloud of Figure 9, the benchmarks focus on fundamental data processing concepts such as data transformation, aggregation, fltering, sorting, and grouping, as well as encompassing machine learning concepts like outlier detection, imbalanced dataset handling, and feature selection.\\nProblem dependencies. DSEval-Kaggle and DSEval-Exercise are two conversational benchmarks where there could be interdependences among problems. We defne \\u201csession dependency\\u201d as a scenario where a variable from a previous problem is used in a subsequent problem, and \\u201csemantic dependency\\u201d as a situation where the comprehension of a later query relies on the context of a preceding query. We visualize dependency graphs for each problem set (see Figure 8b for example). On average, we observe an in-degree of 2.08 across all graphs. Regarding the maximum dependency chain length, the longest chain spans 10 dependencies, with an average chain length of 4.06.\\n\\nSession contexts. A major challenge in our proposed benchmark lies in retrieving and representing contexts from runtime sessions. On average, we estimate that each problem involves 3.68 variables, with a maximum of up to 29. The total data size of these variables is 1.12 kilobytes at the median, and can reach up to 268 megabytes in extreme cases.\"}\n\nIn total, 5 rows are displayed in JSON format."}
