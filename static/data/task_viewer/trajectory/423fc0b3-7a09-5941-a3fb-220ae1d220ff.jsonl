{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The key challenge is that, due to high\\nmorphological complexity and ambiguity of\\nthe space-delimited input tokens, the linguistic\\nunits that act as nodes in the tree are not known\\nin advance. Pre-neural dependency parsers for\\nMRLs subscribed to the joint morpho-syntactic\\nhypothesis, stating that morphological segmen-\\ntation and syntactic parsing should be solved\\njointly, rather than as a pipeline where segmen-\\ntation precedes parsing. However, neural state-\\nof-the-art parsers to date use a strict pipeline.\\nIn this paper we introduce a joint neural archi-\\ntecture where a lattice-based representation pre-\\nserving all morphological ambiguity of the in-\\nput is provided to an arc-factored model, which\\nthen solves the morphological segmentation\\nand syntactic parsing tasks at once. Our exper-\\niments on Hebrew, a rich and highly ambigu-\\nous MRL, demonstrate state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on parsing, tagging and segmentation of\\nthe Hebrew section of UD, using a single model.\\nThis proposed architecture is LLM-based and\\nlanguage agnostic, providing a solid founda-\\ntion for MRLs to obtain further performance\\nimprovements and bridge the gap with other\\nlanguages.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nDependency parsing is the task of automatically\\nanalyzing the syntactic structure of a sentence and\\nexposing the functional relationships between its\\nwords. In the past, dependency parsing was shown\\nto be extremely useful for many language process-\\ning tasks, as machine translation (Galley and Man-\\nning, 2009), question answering (Garimella et al.,\\n2021) and information extraction (Hwang et al.,\\n2020), to name a few.\\nWhile nowadays many\\nEnglish NLP tasks are solved end-to-end using\\nlarge language models (LLMs) and without access-\\ning any symbolic structure, for low- and medium-\\nresource languages, parsers are still indispensable,\\nenabling a host of downstream applications.\\nMost neural state-of-the-art dependency parsers\\nto date presuppose a pipeline architecture (Qi et al.,\\n2020; Honnibal and Montani, 2017; Minh Nguyen\\nand Nguyen, 2021) that includes several analysis\\nstages \\u2014 tokenization, word segmentation, part-\\nof-speech (POS) tagging, morphological feature\\ntagging, dependency parsing, and sometimes also\\nnamed entity recognition \\u2014 and the linguistic fea-\\ntures from each stage are provided as input to the\\ntasks that follow it, and contribute to the overall ef-\\nficacy. In morphologically-rich languages (MRLs),\\nmany raw space-delimited tokens consist of mul-\\ntiple units, each of which serves a distinct role in\\nthe overall syntactic representation (Tsarfaty et al.,\\n2010, 2020). Consequently, segmentation is es-\\nsential for accurate MRL parsing. However, due\\nto high morphological ambiguity, when segmenta-\\ntion is performed prior to (and independently of)\\nthe parsing phase, segmentation errors may prop-\\nagate to undermine the syntactic predictions, and\\nsubsequently lead to an overall incorrect parse.\\nAccording to the joint hypothesis, that was heav-\\nily populated in parsing studies for MRLs in the pre-\\nneural era (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007;\\nGoldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Green and Manning,\\n2010; Seeker and \\u00c7etino\\u02d8\\nglu, 2015), morphological\\nsegmentation and syntactic predictions are mutu-\\nally dependent, and hence, these two tasks should\\nbe solved together.\\nFollowing these lines, More et al. (2019) de-\\nveloped a joint morpho-syntactic transition-based\\nparser that achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results\\non Hebrew parsing. This system employs a mor-\\nphological lattice as input for a transition system,\\nwith both syntactic and morphological transitions,\\nfor picking the right arcs and segments in tan-\\ndem. Another influential work is that of Seeker\\narXiv:2402.02564v2  [cs.CL]  2 Mar 2024\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"and \\u00c7etino\\u02d8\\nglu (2015), that displays all potential\\nsegments that could be involved in any token\\u2019s\\nanalysis, and allows an MST graph-based parser\\npick the highest scoring subset of arcs and nodes\\nas the output dependency tree, showing parsing\\nimprovements for both Hebrew and Turkish. Sim-\\nilarly, Krishna et al. (2020a,b) contributed a non-\\nneural graph-based parser for Sanskrit which em-\\nploy energy-based modeling to determine the op-\\ntimal path on a graph which jointly represents a\\nvalid segmentation and syntactic analysis. How-\\never, this architecture is non-neural and Sanskrit\\nspecific, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted\\nfeature engineering. In neural settings, and still for\\nSanskrit, Sandhan et al. (2021) introduced a pre-\\ntraining approach which focuses on amalgamating\\nword representations generated by encoders trained\\non auxiliary tasks, such as morphological and syn-\\ntactic tags. Unlike the present work, this neural\\narchitecture does not make any segmentation deci-\\nsions nor does it leverage the lattice structure for\\njoint segmentation and parsing.\\nAll in all, in the case of neural multilin-\\ngual dependency parsers, the pipeline approach\\nof segment-then-parse is fully maintained (Kon-\\ndratyuk and Straka, 2019a,b; Minh Nguyen and\\nNguyen, 2021), and no language-agnostic architec-\\nture for morphological segmentation and syntactic\\nparsing is yet to be found.\\nIn this paper we revisit the joint hypothesis as a\\nviable way to improve neural dependency parsing\\nfor MRLs. The idea, in a nutshell, is as follows.\\nWe start off with an arc-factored model (Dozat and\\nManning, 2017) that accepts a sequence of words\\nas input, and generates a dependency tree by pick-\\ning the highest scoring arcs connecting all words.\\nIn our approach, the arc-factored model takes as\\ninput a linearized lattice containing all possible\\nmorphological segments that may potentially act as\\nnodes, and learns to assign a head and label to each\\nsuch node. During training, incorrect segments are\\nmapped to an auxiliary node, of which subtree is\\nexcluded from the final dependency tree. At infer-\\nence time then, the model maps relevant segments\\nto the main branch and unused segments to the\\nauxiliary branch, building a complete dependency\\ntree. In this process, morphological segmentation\\ndecisions get informed by the syntactic arcs, and\\nvice versa. We further extend the architecture with\\na multi-task learning (MTL) component to predict\\nthe features of each node, e.g., POS, gender, num-\\nber and person.\\nOur experiments on the Hebrew Section of UD1\\nshow that in cases where the input morphological\\nanalyses are complete, our model provides new and\\nimproved state of the art results for segmentation\\nand parsing for Hebrew, in a single, jointly trained,\\nmodel. In the more realistic case, where some of\\nthe word lattices may lack possible analyses (the\\ncase of out of vocabulary (OOV) tokens), the model\\nstill delivers competitive results for segmentation,\\ntagging and parsing, outperforming the state-of-\\nthe-art results of the de-facto standard pipelines,\\nStanza and Trankit.\\n2\\nChallenge and Research Objectives\\nThe goal of dependency parsing is to automatically\\nanalyze the syntactic structure of a sentence by\\nindicating the functional relationship between its\\nwords. The input is assumed to be a sequence of\\nspace-delimited tokens that represent words, and\\nthe output is a directed tree where each input word\\nserves as a node, and each arc represents a relation\\nbetween two such words. An arc can be labeled to\\nindicate the relation type between the two words.\\nDeep neural networks have recently achieved\\nunprecedented results in many areas of natural\\nlanguage processing, including the dependency\\nparsing task. The architecture of Dozat and Man-\\nning (2017) (that followed up on Kiperwasser and\\nGoldberg (2016)) is currently accepted as the stan-\\ndard architecture for dependency parsing. Dozat\\nand Manning present a simple neural architecture\\nwhere an arc factored model selects the best set of\\ndependency arcs and labels. This approach is the\\nfoundation of several SOTA dependency parsers,\\nincluding Stanza (Qi et al., 2020) and Trankit\\n(Minh Nguyen and Nguyen, 2021), which have\\nbeen trained and successfully used across differ-\\nent languages. Crucially, these parsers and oth-\\ners (Dozat and Manning, 2017; Qi et al., 2020;\\nMinh Nguyen and Nguyen, 2021; Kondratyuk and\\nStraka, 2019a,b) all subscribe to a pipeline ap-\\nproach, where the input tokens are pre-segmented,\\nand these segments uniquely determine the nodes\\nin the tree.\\nThis pipeline approach has been applied across\\nmany language types, including morphologically\\nrich languages (MRL). However, MRLs pose a\\nsignificant challenge to such architectures.

However,\\ntokens in MRLs are rich and complex, and include\\nmultiple units that can act as individual nodes in\\nthe tree.

When these segments are fixed prior\\nto parsing, wrong segmentation seriously hinders\\nparsing results. The main challenge is then to find\\nthe appropriate segmentation that is relevant to the\\nparticular syntactic context. This challenge is illus-\\ntrated at Figure 1. here we consider the Hebrew\\nphrase \\u2019bclm hneim\\u2019, which can be translated in\\nvarious ways depending on the segmentation anal-\\nysis applied: \\\"In their pleasant shadow\\\", \\\"In the\\npleasant photographer,\\\" or \\\"Their onion was pleas-\\nant\\\". Figure 1 provides a lattice representation of\\nall morphological analyses of the phrase, where\\ndifferent segmentations give rise to substantially\\ndifferent syntactic trees.\\nPre-neural models addressed this challenge by\\njointly modeling morphological segmentation and\\ndependency parsing, and have shown that it yields\\nsuperior results for both tasks. The pressing re-\\nsearch question at hand is whether this hypothesis\\ncan also be validated within the context of neural\\nparsing architectures. In other words, can neural\\nparsing models benefit from a joint approach to\\nsegmentation and parsing, similar to what has been\\nobserved in non-neural models?\\nThis paper addresses two primary objectives.\\nFirstly, we aim to introduce a unified neural ar-\\nchitecture that jointly solves segmentation, tagging\\nand parsing, with the aim of empirically validat-\\ning the joint hypothesis within the realm of neural\\narchitectures. Secondly, we seek to attain state-\\nof-the-art (SOTA) results for Hebrew, a language\\nrenowned for its formidable parsing challenges at-\\ntributed to its substantial morphological ambigu-\\nity.\\n3\\nThe Proposal: A Model for Joint\\nMorphological Segmentation and\\nSyntactic Dependency Parsing\\nTask Definition\\nFormally, our proposed model is\\ndefined as a structure prediction function f : S \\u2192\\nD, where s \\u2208S represents a sequence of raw input\\ntokens, and d \\u2208D denotes a dependency tree with\\nnodes corresponding to disambiguated units, which\\nwe refer to here as morphological segments. Cru-\\ncially, we retain morphological ambiguity, and de-\\nliver all possible analyses of s to the parser. Hence,\\nwe assume a Morphological Analyzer (MA), that\\ngiven an input sentence s = s1, . . . , sk yields a\\ntoken-lattice termed Li = MA(si) for each to-\\nken si. The complete lattice of the input sentence\\nLs = MA(s) is defined as the concatenation of the\\ntoken lattices Ls = MA(s1) \\u25e6\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u25e6MA(sk). Our\\nstructure prediction function becomes f : L \\u2192D,\\nwith Ls \\u2208L as the morphological lattice of s \\u2208S.\\nInput Linearization\\nUpon receiving an input lat-\\ntice Ls, we aim to linearize it in order to be able\\nto encode it as an input vector for the neural archi-\\ntecture. As shall be seen shortly, the linearization\\nis a critical phase for obtaining a neural encoding\\nof the non-linear, morphologically ambiguous, in-\\nput. We illustrate the linearization process using\\nthe Hebrew sentence \\u2019bkrti bbit hlbn\\u2019 (lit: \\\"I-visited\\nin-the-house the-white\\\", trans: \\\"I visited the white\\nhouse\\\").

Crucially, this selected set of arcs does not\\ntake all segments as nodes. On the contrary, the arc\\nselection essentially determines which segments\\nfrom the lattice are included in the final tree, and is\\nsubject to certain constraints, as we detail shortly.\\nLet us define A(Ls) the set of all possible sub-\\nsets of arcs in the linearized lattice. In our model\\nwe aim to select a highest scoring subset A as the\\nDEP tree:\\nDEP = argmaxA\\u2208A(Ls)score(A)\\nTo ensure that the nodes of the selected arcs in\\nA form a valid morpheme sequence, the nodes that\\nparticipate in the subset of arcs must adhere to the\\nfollowing constraints:\\n1.

In the past, dependency parsing was shown\\nto be extremely useful for many language process-\\ning tasks, as machine translation (Galley and Man-\\nning, 2009), question answering (Garimella et al.,\\n2021) and information extraction (Hwang et al.,\\n2020), to name a few.\\nWhile nowadays many\\nEnglish NLP tasks are solved end-to-end using\\nlarge language models (LLMs) and without access-\\ning any symbolic structure, for low- and medium-\\nresource languages, parsers are still indispensable,\\nenabling a host of downstream applications.\\nMost neural state-of-the-art dependency parsers\\nto date presuppose a pipeline architecture (Qi et al.,\\n2020; Honnibal and Montani, 2017; Minh Nguyen\\nand Nguyen, 2021) that includes several analysis\\nstages \\u2014 tokenization, word segmentation, part-\\nof-speech (POS) tagging, morphological feature\\ntagging, dependency parsing, and sometimes also\\nnamed entity recognition \\u2014 and the linguistic fea-\\ntures from each stage are provided as input to the\\ntasks that follow it, and contribute to the overall ef-\\nficacy. In morphologically-rich languages (MRLs),\\nmany raw space-delimited tokens consist of mul-\\ntiple units, each of which serves a distinct role in\\nthe overall syntactic representation (Tsarfaty et al.,\\n2010, 2020). Consequently, segmentation is es-\\nsential for accurate MRL parsing. However, due\\nto high morphological ambiguity, when segmenta-\\ntion is performed prior to (and independently of)\\nthe parsing phase, segmentation errors may prop-\\nagate to undermine the syntactic predictions, and\\nsubsequently lead to an overall incorrect parse.\\nAccording to the joint hypothesis, that was heav-\\nily populated in parsing studies for MRLs in the pre-\\nneural era (Tsarfaty, 2006; Cohen and Smith, 2007;\\nGoldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Green and Manning,\\n2010; Seeker and \\u00c7etino\\u02d8\\nglu, 2015), morphological\\nsegmentation and syntactic predictions are mutu-\\nally dependent, and hence, these two tasks should\\nbe solved together.\\nFollowing these lines, More et al. (2019) de-\\nveloped a joint morpho-syntactic transition-based\\nparser that achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results\\non Hebrew parsing. This system employs a mor-\\nphological lattice as input for a transition system,\\nwith both syntactic and morphological transitions,\\nfor picking the right arcs and segments in tan-\\ndem. Another influential work is that of Seeker\\narXiv:2402.02564v2  [cs.CL]  2 Mar 2024\\nand \\u00c7etino\\u02d8\\nglu (2015), that displays all potential\\nsegments that could be involved in any token\\u2019s\\nanalysis, and allows an MST graph-based parser\\npick the highest scoring subset of arcs and nodes\\nas the output dependency tree, showing parsing\\nimprovements for both Hebrew and Turkish. Sim-\\nilarly, Krishna et al. (2020a,b) contributed a non-\\nneural graph-based parser for Sanskrit which em-\\nploy energy-based modeling to determine the op-\\ntimal path on a graph which jointly represents a\\nvalid segmentation and syntactic analysis. How-\\never, this architecture is non-neural and Sanskrit\\nspecific, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted\\nfeature engineering. In neural settings, and still for\\nSanskrit, Sandhan et al. (2021) introduced a pre-\\ntraining approach which focuses on amalgamating\\nword representations generated by encoders trained\\non auxiliary tasks, such as morphological and syn-\\ntactic tags. Unlike the present work, this neural\\narchitecture does not make any segmentation deci-\\nsions nor does it leverage the lattice structure for\\njoint segmentation and parsing.\\nAll in all, in the case of neural multilin-\\ngual dependency parsers, the pipeline approach\\nof segment-then-parse is fully maintained (Kon-\\ndratyuk and Straka, 2019a,b; Minh Nguyen and\\nNguyen, 2021), and no language-agnostic architec-\\nture for morphological segmentation and syntactic\\nparsing is yet to be found.\\nIn this paper we revisit the joint hypothesis as a\\nviable way to improve neural dependency parsing\\nfor MRLs. The idea, in a nutshell, is as follows.\\nWe start off with an arc-factored model (Dozat and\\nManning, 2017) that accepts a sequence of words\\nas input, and generates a dependency tree by pick-\\ning the highest scoring arcs connecting all words.\\nIn our approach, the arc-factored model takes as\\ninput a linearized lattice containing all possible\\nmorphological segments that may potentially act as\\nnodes, and learns to assign a head and label to each\\nsuch node. During training, incorrect segments are\\nmapped to an auxiliary node, of which subtree is\\nexcluded from the final dependency tree. At infer-\\nence time then, the model maps relevant segments\\nto the main branch and unused segments to the\\nauxiliary branch, building a complete dependency\\ntree. In this process, morphological segmentation\\ndecisions get informed by the syntactic arcs, and\\nvice versa. We further extend the architecture with\\na multi-task learning (MTL) component to predict\\nthe features of each node, e.g., POS, gender, num-\\nber and person.\\nOur experiments on the Hebrew Section of UD1\\nshow that in cases where the input morphological\\nanalyses are complete, our model provides new and\\nimproved state of the art results for segmentation\\nand parsing for Hebrew, in a single, jointly trained,\\nmodel. In the more realistic case, where some of\\nthe word lattices may lack possible analyses (the\\ncase of out of vocabulary (OOV) tokens), the model\\nstill delivers competitive results for segmentation,\\ntagging and parsing, outperforming the state-of-\\nthe-art results of the de-facto standard pipelines,\\nStanza and Trankit.\\n2\"}\n{\"score\":29.5185,\"pdf_id\":\"6873b347-ad4a-544e-b24f-cce1668924b4\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"3bede35a-6eeb-560e-86d7-44ccb97a67e5\",\"text\":\"Challenge and Research Objectives\\nThe goal of dependency parsing is to automatically\\nanalyze the syntactic structure of a sentence by\\nindicating the functional relationship between its\\nwords.

The architecture of Dozat and Man-\\nning (2017) (that followed up on Kiperwasser and\\nGoldberg (2016)) is currently accepted as the stan-\\ndard architecture for dependency parsing.

When these segments are fixed prior\\nto parsing, wrong segmentation seriously hinders\\nparsing results. The main challenge is then to find\\nthe appropriate segmentation that is relevant to the\\nparticular syntactic context. This challenge is illus-\\ntrated at Figure 1. here we consider the Hebrew\\nphrase \\u2019bclm hneim\\u2019, which can be translated in\\nvarious ways depending on the segmentation anal-\\nysis applied: \\\"In their pleasant shadow\\\", \\\"In the\\npleasant photographer,\\\" or \\\"Their onion was pleas-\\nant\\\".

The pressing re-\\nsearch question at hand is whether this hypothesis\\ncan also be validated within the context of neural\\nparsing architectures. In other words, can neural\\nparsing models benefit from a joint approach to\\nsegmentation and parsing, similar to what has been\\nobserved in non-neural models?\\nThis paper addresses two primary objectives.\\nFirstly, we aim to introduce a unified neural ar-\\nchitecture that jointly solves segmentation, tagging\\nand parsing, with the aim of empirically validat-\\ning the joint hypothesis within the realm of neural\\narchitectures. Secondly, we seek to attain state-\\nof-the-art (SOTA) results for Hebrew, a language\\nrenowned for its formidable parsing challenges at-\\ntributed to its substantial morphological ambigu-\\nity.\\n3\\nThe Proposal: A Model for Joint\\nMorphological Segmentation and\\nSyntactic Dependency Parsing\\nTask Definition\\nFormally, our proposed model is\\ndefined as a structure prediction function f : S \\u2192\\nD, where s \\u2208S represents a sequence of raw input\\ntokens, and d \\u2208D denotes a dependency tree with\\nnodes corresponding to disambiguated units, which\\nwe refer to here as morphological segments. Cru-\\ncially, we retain morphological ambiguity, and de-\\nliver all possible analyses of s to the parser. Hence,\\nwe assume a Morphological Analyzer (MA), that\\ngiven an input sentence s = s1, . . . , sk yields a\\ntoken-lattice termed Li = MA(si) for each to-\\nken si. The complete lattice of the input sentence\\nLs = MA(s) is defined as the concatenation of the\\ntoken lattices Ls = MA(s1) \\u25e6\\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u25e6MA(sk).
