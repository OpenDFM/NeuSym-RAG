{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

Although general safety evaluation\\nbenchmarks (Sun et al., 2022, 2023; Zhang et al.,\\n2023) and safeguard measures (OpenAI, 2024), in-\\ncluding the OpenAI moderation API designed to\\nprevent toxic and harmful content, have been pro-\\nposed and some put in place, there is a need for\\nspecialized benchmarks tailored to the unique rules,\\nresponsibilities, and styles of various professional\\n9993\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"domains and scenarios (Berengueres and Sandell,\\n2023; Diakopoulos et al.). In journalism, the signif-\\nicant role it plays in informing the general public\\nand its potential to influence public perception de-\\nmands a higher and more specific ethical and safety\\nstandard.\\nThere are an increasing number of LLMs being\\napplied in Chinese journalism to complete editorial\\ntasks, such as headline generation, summarization,\\ncontinuation writing, expansion writing and refine-\\nment. Despite considerable discussions among the\\nacademia and industry on comprehending, regulat-\\ning, and mitigating the risks associated with LLMs\\nin journalism (Jones et al., 2023; Arguedas and\\nSimon, 2023; Fui-Hoon Nah et al., 2023; Cools\\nand Diakopoulos, 2023), there is a notable absence\\nof a standardized benchmark or systematic evalua-\\ntion framework that assess the alignment of LLMs\\nwith journalistic ethics and safety standard and in-\\ntegrates them with common journalistic editorial\\ntasks.\\nDrawing on discussions about AI safety in jour-\\nnalism (Jones et al., 2023; Cools and Diakopoulos,\\n2023), this paper introduces NewsBench, a sys-\\ntematic evaluation framework which is focused on\\nassessing the editorial capabilities of LLMs for not\\nonly journalistic writing proficiency but also safety\\nadherence. For journalistic writing proficiency, we\\nfocus on language fluency, logical coherence, style\\nalignment, and instruction fulfilment, while for\\nsafety adherence we consider six facets including\\ncivil language, bias and discrimination, personal\\nprivacy, social harm, journalistic ethics, and illegal\\nactivities. We construct the benchmark dataset with\\n1,267 test samples in the types of multiple choice\\nand short answer questions in five editorial tasks\\nincluding headline generation, summarization, con-\\ntinuation of writing, expansion of writing, and style\\nrefinement from 24 news domains. Additionally,\\nNewsBench incorporates two automatic evaluation\\nprotocols for assessing LLM generations for short\\nanswer questions in terms of writing proficiency\\nand safety adherence. Utilizing this comprehen-\\nsive framework, we have evaluated eleven popular\\nLLMs which can handle Chinese, providing in-\\nsights into their performance across a diverse range\\nof journalistic tasks and safety considerations.\\nThe main contributions of the paper are as fol-\\nlows:\\n\\u2022 We propose an evaluation framework for sys-\\ntematically evaluating LLMs on journalistic\\nwriting and safety, and we release 1,267 manu-\\nally designed test samples featuring two types\\nof short answer and multiple choice questions\\nacross five editorial tasks.\\n\\u2022 Two GPT-4 based evaluation protocols for\\njournalistic writing proficiency and safety\\ncompliance are developed and validated by\\nhuman annotation.\\n\\u2022 We conduct a comparative analysis and error\\nassessment of eleven popular LLMs, identi-\\nfying their strengths and weaknesses for ed-\\nitorial tasks in Chinese journalism. GPT-4\\nand ERNIE Bot are identified as leading mod-\\nels while they still have limitations in adher-\\ning to journalistic ethics in creative writing\\ntasks, and LLMs with fewer parameters but\\nmore training tokens are performing better\\nthan those larger ones with fewer training to-\\nkens on our benchmark dataset.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nProminent media outlets, such as the BBC (British\\nBroadcasting Corporation) (Arguedas and Simon,\\n2023), have incorporated LLMs into their news\\nproduction workflow, undertaking tasks such as\\nsummarization, headline generation, translation,\\nand writing style refinement (Fui-Hoon Nah et al.,\\n2023), to speed up and refine their editorial pro-\\ncess. Alongside this evolving technological inte-\\ngration, there is an increasing focus on ensuring the\\nsafety of AI in journalism and embedding ethical\\nand professional journalistic values within these\\ntechnologies (Broussard et al., 2019; Diakopoulos\\net al.). The core concept of professional journal-\\nism ethic emphasize the responsible exercise of\\nthe freedom to publish.2 This concept is expanded\\ninto four key principles by the Society of Profes-\\nsional Journalists: seeking truth, minimizing harm,\\nacting independently, and being accountable. Ef-\\nforts have been undertaken to recommend guide-\\nlines that align LLMs usages with media ethics and\\nsafety standards (Cools and Diakopoulos, 2023;\\nFui-Hoon Nah et al., 2023). Jones et al. (2023)\\ncompiles an exhaustive list of risks associated with\\nthe use of LLMs in journalism covering three ma-\\njor categories including editorial risks, legal and\\nregulatory risks, and societal risks.\\nThere are an increasing number of bench-\\nmarks for assessing the performance and safety\\n2https:\\/\\/www.spj.org\\/ethicscode.asp\\n9994\\n\"}\n{\"page_content\":\"of LLMs (Sun et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023; Sun\\net al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). However, these bench-\\nmarks primarily target general scenarios, while\\nnews media operations necessitate adherence to\\nspecific professional ethics, styling requirements,\\nand safety standards, and bear a greater social re-\\nsponsibility. Zagorulko (2023) are pioneering in\\nevaluating LLMs generated outputs against eval-\\nuation specific to journalism, such as topicality,\\nreliability, balance of opinion, and accuracy of in-\\nformation. However, since the framework requires\\nhuman evaluation, it cannot be efficiently applied\\nto newly emerging LLMs. Despite these recent\\nadvancements, there remains a gap in benchmarks\\nspecifically tailored to evaluate the journalistic writ-\\ning (Hicks et al., 2016) and safety (Jones et al.,\\n2023) of LLMs within the context of specific news\\neditorial tasks.\\n3\\nThe Evaluation Framework\\nThe evaluation framework is designed to conduct a\\ncomprehensive and automated assessment of LLMs\\nfor editorial capabilities with a particular focus on\\njournalistic writing proficiency (JWP) and safety\\nadherence (SA) (Section 3.1). Evaluations are in\\ntypes of short answer questions (SAQs) and mul-\\ntiple choice questions (MCQs) (Section 3.2). To\\naggregate and compare performances of LLMs,\\nwe develop four types of evaluations: JWP on\\nmultiple choice questions (JWP-MCQs), JWP on\\nshort answer questions (JWP-SAQs), SA on multi-\\nple choice questions (SA-MCQs), SA on short an-\\nswer questions (SA-SAQs). Figure 1 illustrates the\\ncomprehensive workflow of our evaluation frame-\\nwork. Specifically, for each LLM to be evaluated,\\nthe framework first takes the four types of evalu-\\nations to elicit corresponding answers for MCQs\\nand SAQs. To get the final performances of the\\nLLM on the four types of evaluations, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric for MCQs while\\nimplementing GPT-4 based evaluation metrics for\\nSAQs.\\n3.1\\nEvaluation Facets for Writing and Safety\\nWe have carefully developed a set of fine-grained\\nevaluation facets based on expertise from profes-\\nsional journalists, ensuring a comprehensive and\\nnuanced assessment of LLM performances against\\nboth journalistic writing standards and safety ad-\\nherence requirements.\\nThe journalistic writing proficiency is defined\\nwith four fine-grained facets to comprehensively\\nevaluate the quality of generated content. (1) Lan-\\nguage Fluency, assesses the fundamental readabil-\\nity and grammatical accuracy of the content, serv-\\ning as the foundation for clear and professional\\ncommunication. (2) Logical Coherence, examines\\nthe organization and logical structuring of content,\\ncrucial for facilitating a sensible and coherent con-\\nveyance of ideas. (3) Style Alignment, evaluates\\nthe content\\u2019s adherence to the concise, accurate,\\nand objective presentation that defines the essence\\nof journalistic writing, ensuring that the output\\nmeets professional journalistic standards. (4) In-\\nstruction Fulfillment, gauges the extent to which\\nthe generations comply with specific instructions\\nand limitations, such as word count limits and pre-\\nscribed formats, reflecting the capabilities of LLMs\\nto follow detailed guidelines and objectives. These\\nfacets provide a robust evaluation of the capabili-\\nties of LLMs in producing content that meets the\\nstandards of journalistic writing. Detailed bilin-\\ngual definitions can be found in Table 26 in the\\nappendix.\\nSafety adherence (SA) is examined across six\\nindependent facets: Civil Language (CIVIL), Bias\\nand Discrimination (BIAS&DIS), Personal Privacy\\n(PRIVACY), Social Harm (SOCIAL), Journalistic\\nEthics (ETHICS), and Illegal Activities (ILLEGAL).\\nThe detailed definition of each facet can be found\\nin Table 11 in the appendix. The selection of these\\nsafety standards results from an extensive literature\\nreview (Jones et al., 2023; Cools and Diakopoulos,\\n2023; Chin, 2023) and consultations with practic-\\ning journalists, ensuring a focused examination\\nrelevant to journalistic safety standards in editorial\\nprocesses. Moreover, the selection takes into ac-\\ncount the potential negative impacts and risks to\\nindividual readers, entities mentioned within the\\ntexts, and society at large.\\n3.2\\nQuestion Types of Test Samples\\nWe develop two different question types for test\\nsamples:\\nshort answer questions (SAQs) and\\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs).

Furthermore, multi-\\nple choice questions offer an efficient complemen-\\ntary method for the automated evaluation of LLM\\nperformance (Zhang et al., 2023).\\n4\\nBenchmark Dataset Construction\\nLLMs are increasingly adopted as editorial assis-\\ntants in the editorial phase of the publishing work-\\nflow in journalism (Fernandes et al., 2023; Chin,\\n2023). Based on existing studies (Arguedas and\\nSimon, 2023; Fernandes et al., 2023) and consult-\\ning with professional journalists, LLMs are usually\\nused on five editorial tasks: Headline Generation\\n(HEAD), Summarization (SUMM), Continuation\\nof Writing (CONT), Expansion of Writing (EXPA),\\nand Style Refinement (REFI). With a focus on these\\nfive editorial tasks, the benchmark dataset is man-\\nually constructed by human experts and it com-\\nprises test samples for these editorial tasks, span-\\nning across various news domains. In our bench-\\nmark dataset, each test sample is assigned with a\\nspecific editorial task.\\n4.1\\nPrompt Formats for Test Samples\\nTo consistently prompt different LLMs, test sam-\\nples follow the two prompt types as depicted in\\nTable 1. Each test sample features a prompt crafted\\naccording to a specific triplet setting, which in-\\ncludes the question type, the editorial task, and the\\ntarget evaluation facet. These prompts provide both\\nan instruction and a context, serving as the input for\\nthe LLMs. Additionally, test samples for multiple\\nchoice questions are supplemented with human-\\nannotated ground truth answers and explanations.\\nThe instructions elaborate on the anticipated role,\\nintended task outcomes, and writing standards and\\nstyle, as well as other constraints such as word\\ncount limitations. To assess the compliance of\\nLLMs with safety standards, certain tasks empha-\\nsize safety performance through the use of adver-\\nsarial instructions aimed at evaluating the capacity\\nto meet defined safety norms. The context com-\\nponent is derived from human-written content that\\nthe LLM is expected to extend or enhance based\\non the given instructions, which could range from\\na segment to an entire news article, depending on\\nthe nature of the editorial task. More detailed ex-\\namples for each type of test samples can be found\\nin Table 17, 18, 19 and 20 in the appendix.\\n4.2\\nDataset Construction by Human Experts\\nThe test sample construction process involves ten\\ngraduate students majoring in journalism, super-\\nvised by a senior professional journalist from a\\nmainstream Chinese news publisher. The develop-\\nment is conducted in an iterative manner. Initially,\\nthe contributors are introduced to the formats, defi-\\nnitions of question types, editorial tasks, and vari-\\nous evaluation facets by the supervisor. For each\\ntest sample, the contributors are assigned a three-\\ndimensional setting: a question type (e.g., MCQ in\\nSection 3.2), an editorial task (e.g., SUMM in Sec-\\ntion 4.3), and a target evaluation facet (e.g., Logical\\n9996\\n\"}\n\n... # only display 4 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

The senior supervising journalist reviews the\\ndraft samples, with typically one to three rounds\\nof feedback before finalization. Some drafts were\\ndiscarded during this iterative process.\\n4.3\\nDataset Statistics and Features\\nConsequently, we have constructed a total of 1,267\\ntest samples, distributed among two question types\\n(Short Answer Questions: 817, multiple choice\\nquestions: 450), five editorial tasks (headline gen-\\neration: 251, summarization: 300, continuation\\nof writing: 255, expansion of writing: 255, style\\nrefinement: 250) and seven facets (journalistic writ-\\ning proficiency: 598, civil language: 128, bias and\\ndiscrimination: 117, personal privacy: 119, social\\nharm: 105, journalistic ethics: 117, illegal activ-\\nities: 83), and 24 news domains (Table 15 in the\\nappendix). It is clear that our test samples are of\\nvarious word lengths in different evaluation types\\nand editorial tasks in Table 2. More statistics across\\nthe five editorial tasks are available in Table 12, 13\\nand 14 in the appendix. In addition to the instruc-\\ntions and context provided by the contributors, the\\ndataset includes human-written answers and ex-\\nplanations for potential future work and research\\nbeyond the proposed evaluation framework.\\n5\\nEvaluation Protocols for Short Answer\\nQuestions\\nThe evaluation framework utilizes the constructed\\ntest samples to automate the reference-free eval-\\nuation of LLMs, focusing on their proficiency in\\ngeneral journalistic writing and their adherence\\nto safety standards. While the evaluation of mul-\\ntiple choice questions can be straightforwardly\\nconducted by calculating accuracy, assessing re-\\nsponses for short answer questions necessitates a\\nmore complicated approach. Drawing on recent\\nadvancements in natural language generation evalu-\\nation methodologies, which have employed LLMs\\nfor the automated assessment of fine-grained at-\\ntributes (Fu et al., 2023), we have developed two\\ndistinctive automatic evaluation protocols. These\\nprotocols are designed to assess general journalistic\\nwriting proficiency and safety standard compliance,\\nrespectively, using LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI,\\n2024). Additionally, we have performed human\\nvalidation to ensure the effectiveness of our eval-\\nuation protocols and their alignment with human\\njudgments.\\n5.1\\nProtocols for Writing Proficiency\\nThe proficiency of journalistic writing is evalu-\\nated through four fine-grained evaluation facets,\\ndescribed in Section 3.1, including Language Flu-\\nency, Logical Coherence, Style Alignment, and In-\\nstruction Fulfillment. Together, the protocol took\\na holistic approach to evaluating journalistic writ-\\ning, adherence to journalistic principles, and the\\ncapacity to meet editorial directives. Consequently,\\nthe evaluation method produced four scores corre-\\nsponding to the four evaluation facets in a single\\nevaluation.\\nUtilizing the four key facets, we develop a\\nweighted scoring system, assigning values for Lan-\\nguage Fluency, Logical Coherence, and Style Align-\\nment from discrete values 1 to 3, and for instruction\\nfulfilment from discrete values 0 or 1. The detailed\\nscoring rubric is available in Table 16 in the ap-\\npendix. To accurately evaluate LLM-generated\\noutputs, specific prompts were developed for each\\nfacet (details in Table 10 in the appendix). The\\noverall cumulative scores across these facets deter-\\nmine the proficiency score of journalistic writing,\\nwith possible average scores ranging from a mini-\\nmum of 0.75 to a maximum of 2.5. This approach\\nensures a comprehensive assessment, capturing the\\nnuanced quality of writing that contribute to jour-\\nnalistic proficiency.\\n5.2\\nProtocols for Safety Adherence\\nIn contrast to the holistic evaluation of writing pro-\\nficiency, we assess each evaluation facet of safety\\nadherence separately.

However, these bench-\\nmarks primarily target general scenarios, while\\nnews media operations necessitate adherence to\\nspecific professional ethics, styling requirements,\\nand safety standards, and bear a greater social re-\\nsponsibility. Zagorulko (2023) are pioneering in\\nevaluating LLMs generated outputs against eval-\\nuation specific to journalism, such as topicality,\\nreliability, balance of opinion, and accuracy of in-\\nformation. However, since the framework requires\\nhuman evaluation, it cannot be efficiently applied\\nto newly emerging LLMs. Despite these recent\\nadvancements, there remains a gap in benchmarks\\nspecifically tailored to evaluate the journalistic writ-\\ning (Hicks et al., 2016) and safety (Jones et al.,\\n2023) of LLMs within the context of specific news\\neditorial tasks.\\n3\\nThe Evaluation Framework\\nThe evaluation framework is designed to conduct a\\ncomprehensive and automated assessment of LLMs\\nfor editorial capabilities with a particular focus on\\njournalistic writing proficiency (JWP) and safety\\nadherence (SA) (Section 3.1). Evaluations are in\\ntypes of short answer questions (SAQs) and mul-\\ntiple choice questions (MCQs) (Section 3.2). To\\naggregate and compare performances of LLMs,\\nwe develop four types of evaluations: JWP on\\nmultiple choice questions (JWP-MCQs), JWP on\\nshort answer questions (JWP-SAQs), SA on multi-\\nple choice questions (SA-MCQs), SA on short an-\\nswer questions (SA-SAQs). Figure 1 illustrates the\\ncomprehensive workflow of our evaluation frame-\\nwork. Specifically, for each LLM to be evaluated,\\nthe framework first takes the four types of evalu-\\nations to elicit corresponding answers for MCQs\\nand SAQs. To get the final performances of the\\nLLM on the four types of evaluations, we adopt\\naccuracy as the evaluation metric for MCQs while\\nimplementing GPT-4 based evaluation metrics for\\nSAQs.\\n3.1\\nEvaluation Facets for Writing and Safety\\nWe have carefully developed a set of fine-grained\\nevaluation facets based on expertise from profes-\\nsional journalists, ensuring a comprehensive and\\nnuanced assessment of LLM performances against\\nboth journalistic writing standards and safety ad-\\nherence requirements.\\nThe journalistic writing proficiency is defined\\nwith four fine-grained facets to comprehensively\\nevaluate the quality of generated content. (1) Lan-\\nguage Fluency, assesses the fundamental readabil-\\nity and grammatical accuracy of the content, serv-\\ning as the foundation for clear and professional\\ncommunication. (2) Logical Coherence, examines\\nthe organization and logical structuring of content,\\ncrucial for facilitating a sensible and coherent con-\\nveyance of ideas. (3) Style Alignment, evaluates\\nthe content\\u2019s adherence to the concise, accurate,\\nand objective presentation that defines the essence\\nof journalistic writing, ensuring that the output\\nmeets professional journalistic standards. (4) In-\\nstruction Fulfillment, gauges the extent to which\\nthe generations comply with specific instructions\\nand limitations, such as word count limits and pre-\\nscribed formats, reflecting the capabilities of LLMs\\nto follow detailed guidelines and objectives. These\\nfacets provide a robust evaluation of the capabili-\\nties of LLMs in producing content that meets the\\nstandards of journalistic writing. Detailed bilin-\\ngual definitions can be found in Table 26 in the\\nappendix.\\nSafety adherence (SA) is examined across six\\nindependent facets: Civil Language (CIVIL), Bias\\nand Discrimination (BIAS&DIS), Personal Privacy\\n(PRIVACY), Social Harm (SOCIAL), Journalistic\\nEthics (ETHICS), and Illegal Activities (ILLEGAL).\\nThe detailed definition of each facet can be found\\nin Table 11 in the appendix.
