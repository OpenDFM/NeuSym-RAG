{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'RetrieveFromVectorstore', 'CalculateExpr', 'ViewImage', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromVectorstore\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore. Please refer to the schema of different collections and fields for each stored data entry.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on input parameters.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromVectorstore(query: str, collection_name: str, table_name: str, column_name: str, filter: str = '', limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- collection_name: str, required. The name of the collection in the Milvus vectorstore to search for relevant context. Please ensure the name comes from existing collection names.\n- table_name: str, required. The table name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing table names which have encodable columns.\n- column_name: str, required. The column name is used to narrow down the search space. It will be added to the filter condition. Please ensure it comes from existing encodable columns in the specified `table_name`.\n- filter: str, optional, default to ''. The filter condition to narrow down the search space. Please refer to the syntax of filter conditions. By default, no filter condition. It is suggested to restrict `primary_key`, `pdf_id`, or `page_number` to refine search results. Note that you do not need to restrict `table_name` and `column_name` since they are already specified in the `table_name` and `column_name` parameters. Thus, if the `filter` parameter is empty, the actual filter condition will be `table_name == '{table_name}' and column_name == '{column_name}'`.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nSearch the entire collection `text_bm25_en`, which use BM25 sparse embeddings, with the filter condition `table_name == 'chunks' and column_name == 'text_content' and pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1` to restrict the content source and return the top 10 relevant entries.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query=\"Does this paper discuss LLM-based agent on its first page? (paper id is '12345678')\", collection_name='text_bm25_en', table_name='chunks', column_name='text_content', filter=\"pdf_id == '12345678' and page_number == 1\", limit=10)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nPerform a similarity search on all cell values from the `abstract` column of the `metadata` table in the database, using the MiniLM-L6-v2 setence transformer embeddings. By default, the top 5 most relevant entries will be returned based on vector similarity.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromVectorstore(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?', collection_name='text_sentence_transformers_all_minilm_l6_v2', table_name='metadata', column_name='abstract')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nCalculateExpr\n\n### Description\nCalculate the expression and return the result. The expression should be a Python-style arithmetic expression that can be correctly processed by `eval()`.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the result of the expression calculation. You do not need to worry about the actual calculation, we will perform it for you. If the calculation failed, we will return the error message.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nCalculateExpr(expr: str)\n- expr: str, required. The expression to calculate.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nCalculate the expression 2 + 3 * 4.\n\n[Action]: CalculateExpr(expr='2 + 3 * 4')\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nViewImage\n\n### Description\nYou can retrieve the visual information of the paper by taking this action. Please provide the paper id, the page number, and the optional bounding box.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the image that you want to view. We will show you the image according to your parameters. The error message will be shown if there is any problem with the image retrieval.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nViewImage(paper_id: str, page_number: int, bounding_box: List[float] = [])\n- paper_id: str, required. The paper id to retrieve the image.\n- page_number: int, required. The page number (starting from 1) of the paper to retrieve the image.\n- bounding_box: List[float], optional, default to []. The bounding box of the image to retrieve. The format is [x_min, y_min, delta_x, delta_y]. The complete page will be retrieved if not provided.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve the image of the third page of the paper with id 12345678.\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=3, bounding_box=[])\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve the image of the fifth page of the paper with id 12345678, with a bounding box of [51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8].\n\n[Action]: ViewImage(paper_id='12345678', page_number=5, bounding_box=[51.1, 204.3, 333.0, 13.8])\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the user’s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

{"role": "user", "content": "[Observation]:\n{\"section_content\":\"Introduction\\nA pinnacle of human intelligence is the ability to communicate with an environment, forming\\ncomplex interactions to accomplish challenging goals. Dialogues are one example of such dynamic\\ncommunication, where one party reacts to signals from the other parties and dynamically plans ahead\\nto steer communication towards their purpose. Recent years have seen scienti\\ufb01c breakthroughs in\\ndeveloping Large Language Models (LLMs) that can communicate with humans in natural language\\n[Ouyang et al., 2022, Anil et al., 2023, Touvron et al., 2023, OpenAI, 2024, Google, 2024]. In order\\nto align these models to human needs, many efforts have been made to train them with a given\\nhuman feedback. In some concordance with human learning, this is usually achieved by reinforcing\\nbehaviors that align with the feedback, using a technique now called Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al. [2017], Ziegler et al. [2019], Stiennon et al. [2020]).\\nRLHF methods build on the long studied \\ufb01eld of Reinforcement Learning (RL), which focuses\\non learning optimal actions through reward feedback (a numerical signal) from the environment.\\nHowever, de\\ufb01ning a suitable reward function is challenging, leading to the common practice of\\ncollecting human preferences between choices. In the absence of rewards, a mapping from preference\\nto reward is typically assumed in the form of the Bradely-Terry (BT; Bradley and Terry [1952]) model\\n[Stiennon et al., 2020, Rafailov et al., 2023], enabling the use of a wide-variety of well-researched\\n\\u22c6Equal contribution. 1 Google Research. 2 Google DeepMind. 3 Tel Aviv University.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nRL techniques. Alternatively, recent research [Munos et al., 2023, Azar et al., 2023, Tang et al.,\\n2024] suggests a more direct use of preferences for learning, eliminating the need for this potentially\\nlimiting assumption.\\nStill, so far the main focus of both the RLHF and the direct preference learning literature was on\\nsingle-turn scenarios, where given relevant context, the LLM generates one response and receives an\\nimmediate feedback that re\\ufb02ects its alignment quality. Importantly, while single-turn RLHF already\\nprovides signi\\ufb01cant gains for valuable AI systems, it lacks the adaptive and long-term capabilities\\nthat make human communication such a powerful tool, and usually characterize RL methods. This is\\nespecially apparent in temporally extended tasks, such as multi-turn dialogue [Irvine et al., 2023],\\ncomplex tool use [Wang et al., 2022] and multi-step games [Hendrycks et al., 2022].\\nContributions.\\nIn this work, we focus on improving the communication of AI agents with dynamic\\nenvironments. To this end, we \\ufb01rst extend the RLHF paradigm to the multi-turn setting, where the\\nagent has a series of exchanges with an external (stochastic) environment (Section 3). Importantly, we\\nconsider (human) feedback that compares entire multi-turn conversations as opposed to single-turn\\nscenarios, which compare individual actions on a per-turn basis. Conversation-level feedback allows\\nto capture the long-term effect of individual actions, which may not be immediately apparent, and\\nthus hard to de\\ufb01ne through turn-level feedback. For example, a seller agent asking too high a price\\nmay seem immediately bad, but becomes potentially good as part of a complete strategy to increase\\nsale price. This difference is apparent in our preference model, making it better suited for multi-turn\\ninteractions.\\nFormalizing the multi-turn setting as a Contextual Markov Decision Process with end of interaction\\npreference feedback, we devise several theoretically grounded algorithms (Section 4). Our main\\nalgorithm, Multi-turn Preference Optimization (MTPO), is a new policy optimization algorithm for\\nthe general multi-turn preference-based setting. MTPO is based on the Mirror Descent (MD) method\\n[Nemirovskij and Yudin, 1983, Beck and Teboulle, 2003] together with self-play [Silver et al., 2017],\\nand is proven to converge to a Nash equilibrium [Nash et al., 1950], i.e., a policy which is preferred\\nover any other policy. We prove similar results for MTPO\\u2212\\u03c4, a slight variant of MTPO that, similarly\\nto Munos et al. [2023], uses a geometric mixture policy which interpolates the agent\\u2019s policy with a\\n\\ufb01xed reference policy (with mixing rate \\u03c4). These algorithms utilize a new form of preference-based\\nQ-function that accounts for the long-term consequences of individual actions. Finally, leveraging\\nour theoretical framework, we modify this Q-function to create a multi-turn RLHF algorithm and\\nprove its convergence to an optimal policy (w.r.t the learned reward function).\\nWe complement our theoretical \\ufb01ndings with a policy-gradient version of our multi-turn algorithms\\nfor deep learning architectures (Section 4.1). To validate our approach, we apply our algorithms\\nto train a T5 encoder-decoder LLM [Raffel et al., 2020], aiming to enhance its multi-turn dialogue\\nabilities (Sections 5 and 6). We test our approach in a scenario without explicit rewards, where\\nconversation quality is evaluated solely through preferences. To that end, we create a new environment\\ncalled Education Dialogue, where a teacher guides a student in learning a random topic, by prompting\\nGemini [Team et al., 2023]. The conversation is judged based on preference feedback, using a\\nconstitution that de\\ufb01nes effective learning [Bai et al., 2022, Lee et al., 2023] (see Section 5). In\\nthis environment, our multi-turn algorithms signi\\ufb01cantly outperform single-turn baselines, and our\\ndirect multi-turn preference approach outperforms multi-turn RLHF (Section 6). As an additional\\ncontribution, we publicly release the data of Education Dialogue.1 Finally, we demonstrate that even\\nin a reward-based environment, our preference-based algorithm achieves comparable performance to\\nlearning directly from rewards, as in standard RL, despite using a weaker signal. For this experiment,\\nwe utilize the LMRL-Gym [Abdulhai et al., 2023] Car Dealer environment, simulating a conversation\\nwhere the agent (car dealer) aims to maximize the sale price.\\nRelated work.\\nMost related to our work is the RLHF literature, which aims to improve an LLM\\npolicy using preference data collected from humans. Earlier methods model a proxy reward [Ouyang\\net al., 2022] or preference function [Zhao et al., 2022], and apply traditional RL techniques. More\\nrecent methods directly optimize the policy [Rafailov et al., 2023, Azar et al., 2023, Tang et al., 2024,\\nSong et al., 2024, Ethayarajh et al., 2024]. Another line of work, which forms the basis for MTPO,\\nextends RLHF to games, aiming to compute a Nash equilibrium instead of an optimal policy w.r.t a\\n\\ufb01xed reward\\/preference. This includes Nash-MD [Munos et al., 2023], self-play and mixtures of the\\n1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/google-research-datasets\\/Education-Dialogue-Dataset\\n2\\ntwo like IPO-MD [Calandriello et al., 2024]. Nonetheless, these methods only consider single-turn\\nproblems, whereas MTPO provides the \\ufb01rst guarantees for multi-turn settings. Note the difference\\nfrom concurrent attempts to extend direct preference optimization to the token level [Rafailov et al.,\\n2024], while a true multi-turn approach must deal with the additional uncontrollable tokens generated\\nby the human in-between agent turns.\\nMore broadly, preference-based RL (see survey by Wirth et al. [2017]) studies feedback in terms of\\npreferences over two alternatives rather than absolute rewards. Feedback can be provided in various\\nways, e.g., at the level of states (turn-level), or entire trajectories [Chen et al., 2022, Saha et al.,\\n2023, Wu and Sun, 2023, Wang et al., 2023, Zhan et al., 2023a,b]. The focus of this work is last\\nstate feedback which is an instance of trajectory feedback. Another closely related model is RL with\\naggregate feedback where only the sum of rewards in a trajectory is revealed to the agent [Efroni\\net al., 2021, Cohen et al., 2021, Chatterji et al., 2021, Cassel et al., 2024].\\nLastly, there is vast literature on using RL to improve natural language generation for dialogue\\nsystems. The pioneering work of Li et al. [2016] focuses on designing rewards to capture important\\ndialogue attributes such as semantic coherence and ease of answering. Other works tackle task-\\noriented dialogue, using RL to enhance the agent\\u2019s ability to solve the underlying dialogue task [Wei\\net al., 2018]. Instead, this works takes a more general and fundamental approach, focusing on the\\nalgorithmic process of aligning an agent which repeatedly interacts with an environment. While\\ndialogue systems are a promising application of our approach, as suggested by the experimental\\nresults of this paper (Sections 5 and 6), our algorithmic approach is much broader, including processes\\nsuch as tool-use, reasoning, and many other applications that require aligning a complex multi-turn\\nagent with human preferences.\\n2\"}\n{\"section_content\":\"Preliminaries\\nThe interaction between an AI agent and its environment is captured in the fundamental contextual\\nRL model, where the context is the initial prompt, the states are conversation summaries, and the\\nactions are responses.\\nContextual Markov decision process. A \\ufb01nite-horizon contextual Markov decision process (CMDP)\\nM is de\\ufb01ned by a tuple (C,X,Y,H,x1,\\u03c1c,p) where C is the context space, X is the state space, Y\\nis the action space, H is the horizon, x1 \\u2208X is the initial state, \\u03c1c \\u2208\\u2206C is the context distribution and\\np \\u2236C \\u00d7 X \\u00d7 Y \\u2192\\u2206X is the transition function such that p(x\\u2032 \\u2223c,x,y) is the probability to transition\\nto state x\\u2032 after taking action y in state x, given context c.\\nAn interaction between the agent and the CMDP environment proceeds in H steps. First, a context\\nc \\u2208C is sampled from \\u03c1c, and then the agent begins in the initial state x1. In step h \\u2208[H], the\\nagent observes the current state xh \\u2208X, picks an action yh \\u2208Y and transitions to the next state\\nxh+1 sampled from the transition function p(\\u22c5\\u2223c,xh,yh). At the end of the interaction, the agent\\narrives in a \\ufb01nal state xH+1. For simplicity, we assume that the state space can be decomposed into\\nH + 1 disjoint subsets X = \\u228dH+1\\nh=1 Xh such that, in step h of the interaction, the agent is in some state\\nxh \\u2208Xh. A policy \\u03c0 \\u2236C \\u00d7 X \\u2192\\u2206Y is a mapping from a context and state to a distribution over\\nactions. Together with transition p, \\u03c0 induces a distribution over trajectories denoted by Pr\\u03c0,p[\\u22c5] (and\\nE\\u03c0,p[\\u22c5] for the expectation), in which the trajectory is generated by sampling the actions according to\\nthe policy and next states according to the environment.\\n2.1\\nSingle-turn Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\\nUnlike standard RL where the agent observes reward feedback for its actions, the in\\ufb02uential work\\nof Christiano et al. [2017] suggests to leverage preference data. In the single-turn setting, the agent\\ngenerates a single sequence y \\u2208Y given a context c \\u2208C. This is modeled as a Contextual Multi-\\nArmed Bandit (CMAB), which is a CMDP instance with horizon H = 1. The feedback is given\\nin the form of preference between two generated sequences. Formally, there exists a preference\\nmodel P \\u2236C \\u00d7 Y \\u00d7 Y \\u2192[0,1] such that P(y \\u227by\\u2032 \\u2223c) gives the probability that y is preferred\\nover y\\u2032 given context c. Preferences naturally extend to policies via expectation P(\\u03c0 \\u227b\\u03c0\\u2032 \\u2223c) =\\nEy\\u223c\\u03c0(\\u22c5\\u2223c),y\\u2032\\u223c\\u03c0\\u2032(\\u22c5\\u2223c)[P(y \\u227by\\u2032 \\u2223c)].\\n3\\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback.\\nIn RLHF, it is assumed that there is a hidden\\nreward function r \\u2236C \\u00d7 Y \\u2192R that de\\ufb01nes the preferences through the Bradely-Terry (BT) model,\\ni.e., P(y \\u227by\\u2032 \\u2223c) = \\u03c3(r(c,y) \\u2212r(c,y\\u2032)), where \\u03c3 is the sigmoid. To reconstruct the reward, the RL\\nalgorithm is used to optimize the ELO score of the chosen action y using a cross-entropy loss. This\\ntechnique was adapted to RL \\ufb01ne-tuning LLMs [Ziegler et al., 2019], and has become the standard\\napproach for aligning LLMs to human feedback [Stiennon et al., 2020, Rafailov et al., 2023].\\nLearning from direct preferences.\\nRecently Munos et al.

Similarly to the single-turn case, we consider preference-\\nbased RL, where the feedback is given as preference instead of reward. However, in our case, we\\nassume preferences are between \\ufb01nal CMDP states with a shared initial context. Formally, there\\nexists a preference model P \\u2236C \\u00d7 XH+1 \\u00d7 XH+1 \\u2192[0,1] such that P(xH+1 \\u227bx\\u2032\\nH+1 \\u2223c) gives the\\nprobability that xH+1 is preferred over x\\u2032\\nH+1 given context c. That is, in order to receive feedback, a\\nlearning algorithm performs two interactions with the environment and observes a Bernoulli sample\\nfor which one is preferred. We follow the natural assumption of Munos et al. [2023] that the\\npreference model is symmetric, i.e., P(x\\u2032\\nH+1 \\u227bxH+1 \\u2223c) = 1 \\u2212P(xH+1 \\u227bx\\u2032\\nH+1 \\u2223c).

For brevity, since contexts are independent, we omit the\\ncontext throughout the rest of the paper. Similarly to Munos et al. [2023], our objective is to \\ufb01nd a\\npolicy \\u03c0\\u22c6which is preferred over any other alternative policy, i.e.,\\n\\u03c0\\u22c6\\u2208arg max\\n\\u03c0\\nmin\\n\\u03c0\\u2032 P(\\u03c0 \\u227b\\u03c0\\u2032),\\nwhich is a Nash equilibrium in the above two-player game de\\ufb01ned by the preference model, following\\nthe minimax theorem [Von Neumann, 1928] (see Lemma 3.2). Notably, due to the anti-symmetric\\nnature of the preference objective, the Nash equilibrium will have both agents following the same\\npolicy, and thus can be expressed as a single policy.\\nRegularized preference model.\\nIn the rest of the paper, we will consider a regularized version of\\nthe preference model. This is motivated by practical RLHF algorithms [Stiennon et al., 2020], and\\ngeneralizes the single-turn model in Munos et al. [2023]. Let \\u00b5 be a reference policy, and de\\ufb01ne the\\n\\u03b1-regularized preference model as follows:\\nP\\u03b1(\\u03c0 \\u227b\\u03c0\\u2032) = P(\\u03c0 \\u227b\\u03c0\\u2032) \\u2212\\u03b1KLp(\\u03c0\\u2223\\u2223\\u00b5) + \\u03b1KLp(\\u03c0\\u2032\\u2223\\u2223\\u00b5),\\nwhere KLp(\\u22c5\\u2223\\u2223\\u22c5) is the KL-divergence between the distributions that the policies induce over trajecto-\\nries in the CMDP. We prove the following two results for the regularized preference model. First,\\nits KL term has a value difference-like decomposition into the KL-divergences at individual states.\\nSecond, it has a unique Nash equilibrium (proofs in Appendix A).\\nLemma 3.1. Let \\u03c0,\\u03c0\\u2032 be two policies, then: KLp(\\u03c0\\u2223\\u2223\\u03c0\\u2032) = E\\u03c0,p[\\u2211H\\nh=1 KL(\\u03c0\\u2223\\u2223\\u03c0\\u2032)[xh]].\\nLemma 3.2. There exists a unique Nash equilibrium of the regularized preference model P\\u03b1.\\nTrajectory-wise vs. turn-wise preference feedback.\\nA naive adaptation of single-turn RLHF to\\nthe multi-turn scenario would treat each turn as a separate single-turn problem. This would require\\nfeedback for the preference between two actions in each turn. Instead, in the setting we consider, the\\n4\\npreference feedback is only between two full trajectories. Note that a single feedback for the entire\\ntrajectory is much more natural when considering conversations, since only the full conversations tell\\nwhether the objective was reached. Moreover, collecting preference data for intermediate actions\\ncould lead to destructive biases because the quality of an action can change dramatically depending\\non the actions taken later in the trajectory. For example, a chatbot directly answering a user query is\\nusually a required behavior. Yet, when the chatbot does not have suf\\ufb01cient information to respond\\nwell, asking the user for more details might be a better action. Consequently, it is very hard for a rater\\nto know which of these actions is better without observing how the conversation unrolls, i.e., without\\nobserving the user\\u2019s reaction to the chatbot\\u2019s question, and how the chatbot\\u2019s response changes given\\nthis reaction. This difference demonstrates the challenge of multi-turn RL as it requires planning\\nahead instead of myopic reward maximization, which is the approach for single-turn RL.\\nThe multi-turn setting in LLMs.\\nWhile we consider a general preference-based RL setup (through\\nthe CMDP model), our focus is on applying this framework to multi-turn language-based interactions.\\nThe action space Y is a sequence of tokens of a vocabulary V, and the state space at step h, Xh, is a\\nsequence based on the past sequences. For example, in conversational dialogues, the state xh holds\\nthe whole dialogue up to the h-th turn, the action yh is the current sequence generated by the agent,\\nand the next-state is simply the concatenation of the conversation xh with the new yh and a next\\nsequence sampled by the environment (the user\\u2019s response). Alternatively, in the complex tool-use\\ncase, where an agent repeatedly interacts with different APIs, the current state includes the original\\nuser query and a summary of results from APIs so far, the action is a new API call or user-facing\\nresponse, and next state is a new sequence summarizing previous state with the new API response.\\nRemark 3.3 (Token-level application to the single-turn auto-regressive case). Notably, this formula-\\ntion also captures the single-turn auto-regressive case. Clearly, this holds when considering only\\none turn, H = 1, but it ignores the token-level optimization done at each turn. Instead, we frame the\\nauto-regressive problem by limiting the actions at each step to single vocabulary tokens, Y = V, and\\nassuming a null deterministic environment (xh+1 is the concatenation of xh and yh). Importantly,\\nour results apply to the token-level, which is usually neglected when devising single-turn algorithms.\\n4\"}\n\n... # only display 3 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}

Dialogues are one example of such dynamic\\ncommunication, where one party reacts to signals from the other parties and dynamically plans ahead\\nto steer communication towards their purpose. Recent years have seen scienti\\ufb01c breakthroughs in\\ndeveloping Large Language Models (LLMs) that can communicate with humans in natural language\\n[Ouyang et al., 2022, Anil et al., 2023, Touvron et al., 2023, OpenAI, 2024, Google, 2024]. In order\\nto align these models to human needs, many efforts have been made to train them with a given\\nhuman feedback. In some concordance with human learning, this is usually achieved by reinforcing\\nbehaviors that align with the feedback, using a technique now called Reinforcement Learning from\\nHuman Feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al. [2017], Ziegler et al. [2019], Stiennon et al. [2020]).\\nRLHF methods build on the long studied \\ufb01eld of Reinforcement Learning (RL), which focuses\\non learning optimal actions through reward feedback (a numerical signal) from the environment.\\nHowever, de\\ufb01ning a suitable reward function is challenging, leading to the common practice of\\ncollecting human preferences between choices. In the absence of rewards, a mapping from preference\\nto reward is typically assumed in the form of the Bradely-Terry (BT; Bradley and Terry [1952]) model\\n[Stiennon et al., 2020, Rafailov et al., 2023], enabling the use of a wide-variety of well-researched\\n\\u22c6Equal contribution. 1 Google Research. 2 Google DeepMind. 3 Tel Aviv University.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).\\nRL techniques. Alternatively, recent research [Munos et al., 2023, Azar et al., 2023, Tang et al.,\\n2024] suggests a more direct use of preferences for learning, eliminating the need for this potentially\\nlimiting assumption.\\nStill, so far the main focus of both the RLHF and the direct preference learning literature was on\\nsingle-turn scenarios, where given relevant context, the LLM generates one response and receives an\\nimmediate feedback that re\\ufb02ects its alignment quality. Importantly, while single-turn RLHF already\\nprovides signi\\ufb01cant gains for valuable AI systems, it lacks the adaptive and long-term capabilities\\nthat make human communication such a powerful tool, and usually characterize RL methods. This is\\nespecially apparent in temporally extended tasks, such as multi-turn dialogue [Irvine et al., 2023],\\ncomplex tool use [Wang et al., 2022] and multi-step games [Hendrycks et al., 2022].\\nContributions.\\nIn this work, we focus on improving the communication of AI agents with dynamic\\nenvironments. To this end, we \\ufb01rst extend the RLHF paradigm to the multi-turn setting, where the\\nagent has a series of exchanges with an external (stochastic) environment (Section 3). Importantly, we\\nconsider (human) feedback that compares entire multi-turn conversations as opposed to single-turn\\nscenarios, which compare individual actions on a per-turn basis. Conversation-level feedback allows\\nto capture the long-term effect of individual actions, which may not be immediately apparent, and\\nthus hard to de\\ufb01ne through turn-level feedback. For example, a seller agent asking too high a price\\nmay seem immediately bad, but becomes potentially good as part of a complete strategy to increase\\nsale price. This difference is apparent in our preference model, making it better suited for multi-turn\\ninteractions.\\nFormalizing the multi-turn setting as a Contextual Markov Decision Process with end of interaction\\npreference feedback, we devise several theoretically grounded algorithms (Section 4). Our main\\nalgorithm, Multi-turn Preference Optimization (MTPO), is a new policy optimization algorithm for\\nthe general multi-turn preference-based setting. MTPO is based on the Mirror Descent (MD) method\\n[Nemirovskij and Yudin, 1983, Beck and Teboulle, 2003] together with self-play [Silver et al., 2017],\\nand is proven to converge to a Nash equilibrium [Nash et al., 1950], i.e., a policy which is preferred\\nover any other policy. We prove similar results for MTPO\\u2212\\u03c4, a slight variant of MTPO that, similarly\\nto Munos et al. [2023], uses a geometric mixture policy which interpolates the agent\\u2019s policy with a\\n\\ufb01xed reference policy (with mixing rate \\u03c4). These algorithms utilize a new form of preference-based\\nQ-function that accounts for the long-term consequences of individual actions. Finally, leveraging\\nour theoretical framework, we modify this Q-function to create a multi-turn RLHF algorithm and\\nprove its convergence to an optimal policy (w.r.t the learned reward function).\\nWe complement our theoretical \\ufb01ndings with a policy-gradient version of our multi-turn algorithms\\nfor deep learning architectures (Section 4.1). To validate our approach, we apply our algorithms\\nto train a T5 encoder-decoder LLM [Raffel et al., 2020], aiming to enhance its multi-turn dialogue\\nabilities (Sections 5 and 6). We test our approach in a scenario without explicit rewards, where\\nconversation quality is evaluated solely through preferences. To that end, we create a new environment\\ncalled Education Dialogue, where a teacher guides a student in learning a random topic, by prompting\\nGemini [Team et al., 2023]. The conversation is judged based on preference feedback, using a\\nconstitution that de\\ufb01nes effective learning [Bai et al., 2022, Lee et al., 2023] (see Section 5). In\\nthis environment, our multi-turn algorithms signi\\ufb01cantly outperform single-turn baselines, and our\\ndirect multi-turn preference approach outperforms multi-turn RLHF (Section 6). As an additional\\ncontribution, we publicly release the data of Education Dialogue.1 Finally, we demonstrate that even\\nin a reward-based environment, our preference-based algorithm achieves comparable performance to\\nlearning directly from rewards, as in standard RL, despite using a weaker signal. For this experiment,\\nwe utilize the LMRL-Gym [Abdulhai et al., 2023] Car Dealer environment, simulating a conversation\\nwhere the agent (car dealer) aims to maximize the sale price.\\nRelated work.\\nMost related to our work is the RLHF literature, which aims to improve an LLM\\npolicy using preference data collected from humans. Earlier methods model a proxy reward [Ouyang\\net al., 2022] or preference function [Zhao et al., 2022], and apply traditional RL techniques. More\\nrecent methods directly optimize the policy [Rafailov et al., 2023, Azar et al., 2023, Tang et al., 2024,\\nSong et al., 2024, Ethayarajh et al., 2024]. Another line of work, which forms the basis for MTPO,\\nextends RLHF to games, aiming to compute a Nash equilibrium instead of an optimal policy w.r.t a\\n\\ufb01xed reward\\/preference. This includes Nash-MD [Munos et al., 2023], self-play and mixtures of the\\n1https:\\/\\/github.com\\/google-research-datasets\\/Education-Dialogue-Dataset\\n2\\ntwo like IPO-MD [Calandriello et al., 2024]. Nonetheless, these methods only consider single-turn\\nproblems, whereas MTPO provides the \\ufb01rst guarantees for multi-turn settings. Note the difference\\nfrom concurrent attempts to extend direct preference optimization to the token level [Rafailov et al.,\\n2024], while a true multi-turn approach must deal with the additional uncontrollable tokens generated\\nby the human in-between agent turns.\\nMore broadly, preference-based RL (see survey by Wirth et al. [2017]) studies feedback in terms of\\npreferences over two alternatives rather than absolute rewards. Feedback can be provided in various\\nways, e.g., at the level of states (turn-level), or entire trajectories [Chen et al., 2022, Saha et al.,\\n2023, Wu and Sun, 2023, Wang et al., 2023, Zhan et al., 2023a,b]. The focus of this work is last\\nstate feedback which is an instance of trajectory feedback. Another closely related model is RL with\\naggregate feedback where only the sum of rewards in a trajectory is revealed to the agent [Efroni\\net al., 2021, Cohen et al., 2021, Chatterji et al., 2021, Cassel et al., 2024].\\nLastly, there is vast literature on using RL to improve natural language generation for dialogue\\nsystems. The pioneering work of Li et al. [2016] focuses on designing rewards to capture important\\ndialogue attributes such as semantic coherence and ease of answering. Other works tackle task-\\noriented dialogue, using RL to enhance the agent\\u2019s ability to solve the underlying dialogue task [Wei\\net al., 2018]. Instead, this works takes a more general and fundamental approach, focusing on the\\nalgorithmic process of aligning an agent which repeatedly interacts with an environment. While\\ndialogue systems are a promising application of our approach, as suggested by the experimental\\nresults of this paper (Sections 5 and 6), our algorithmic approach is much broader, including processes\\nsuch as tool-use, reasoning, and many other applications that require aligning a complex multi-turn\\nagent with human preferences.\\n2\"}\n{\"score\":0.4855,\"pdf_id\":\"e5838af7-f285-5a91-8e5a-d9d1370f97ab\",\"page_number\":-1,\"table_name\":\"sections\",\"column_name\":\"section_content\",\"primary_key\":\"1f4f21c3-5aa0-5c22-a28e-5cd0786337ab\",\"text\":\"Experimental Setup\\nThis section describes the domains and models used in our experiments.

The reward is calculated by prompting a Flan-T5 model to extract the sale price\\nfrom the conversation, whenever a sale has occurred. When using a preference-based algorithm, the\\npreference of one trajectory over the other is computed using the BT model with the rewards of the\\ntwo trajectories.\\nSingle-turn baselines.\\nThe key hypothesis of this work is that conversation-level signals are\\npreferred over single-turn signals for optimizing multi-turn trajectories. To verify this in the Education\\nDialogue domain, we devise two single-turn baselines by sampling data where each conversation\\nturn has two different policy responses. The \\ufb01rst baseline, called single-turn-reward, rates the two\\nresponses using a modi\\ufb01ed preference prompt (see Appendix C), in which the model is asked to\\nevaluate the responses by their effect on the overall conversation. This technique is prevalent when\\nhuman raters are asked to evaluate multi-turn data. The second baseline, called single-turn-value,\\nassumes access to a Monte-Carlo estimate of the value: it uses our original preference prompt (see\\nFigure 1) by continuing the trajectories of both possibilities and then calculating the preference in the\\nend. For both baselines, we train an RLHF algorithm and a preference-based Nash-MD algorithm.\\nModels.\\nThe agent and environment are modeled with T5 encoder-decoder models. Speci\\ufb01cally,\\nwe use the T5-large (770M) and T5-XL (3B) models. The same models are used for the RLHF\\nBT-based reward and preference-based models. For prompted reward\\/preference models, we make\\nuse of the Flan-T5 XL (3B) [Chung et al., 2024]. For training, we use a con\\ufb01guration of 4 \\u00d7 4 Tensor\\nProcessing Units (TPUs; Jouppi et al. [2023]) which typically yields 0.1 training steps per second,\\nwhere a step consists of learning a 10-turn episode. A detailed list of hyperparameters is found in\\nAppendix D. We run each evaluation on 1600 random samples from an independent evaluation set.\\n6\"}\n\n... # only display 2 rows in JSON format, more are truncated due to length constraint based on max_tokens (5000)"}
