To this end, this paper proposes to probe the ability of GPT-3 to detect metaphoric language and predict the metaphor{'}s source domain without any pre-set domains. We experiment with different training sample configurations for fine-tuning and few-shot prompting on two distinct datasets. When provided 12 few-shot samples in the prompt, GPT-3 generates the correct source domain for a new sample with an accuracy of 65.15{\\%} in English and 34.65{\\%} in Spanish. GPT{'}s most common error is a hallucinated source domain for which no indicator is present in the sentence. Other common errors include identifying a sequence as literal even though a metaphor is present and predicting the wrong source domain based on specific words in the sequence that are not metaphorically related to the target domain.\",\n}\n",
