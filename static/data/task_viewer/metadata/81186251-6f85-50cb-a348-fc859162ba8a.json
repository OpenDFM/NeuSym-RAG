    "abstract": "Lay summarisation aims to jointly summarise and simplify a given text, thus\nmaking its content more comprehensible to non-experts. Automatic approaches for\nlay summarisation can provide significant value in broadening access to\nscientific literature, enabling a greater degree of both interdisciplinary\nknowledge sharing and public understanding when it comes to research findings.\nHowever, current corpora for this task are limited in their size and scope,\nhindering the development of broadly applicable data-driven approaches. Aiming\nto rectify these issues, we present two novel lay summarisation datasets, PLOS\n(large-scale) and eLife (medium-scale), each of which contains biomedical\njournal articles alongside expert-written lay summaries. We provide a thorough\ncharacterisation of our lay summaries, highlighting differing levels of\nreadability and abstractiveness between datasets that can be leveraged to\nsupport the needs of different applications. Finally, we benchmark our datasets\nusing mainstream summarisation approaches and perform a manual evaluation with\ndomain experts, demonstrating their utility and casting light on the key\nchallenges of this task.",
