    "abstract": "We present a new dataset with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in\nobject recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context\nof the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering\nimages of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural\ncontext. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise\nobject localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would\nbe easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled\ninstances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd\nworker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance\nspotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis\nof the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide\nbaseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection\nresults using a Deformable Parts Model.",
