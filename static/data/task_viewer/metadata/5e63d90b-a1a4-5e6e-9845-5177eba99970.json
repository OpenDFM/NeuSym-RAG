    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the  $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ which significantly reduces its memory footprint.  Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. \n We call these tokens Heavy Hitters ($\\mathsf{H_2}$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that ($i$) the emergence of $\\mathsf{H_2}$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and ($ii$) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle ($\\mathsf{H_2O}$), a $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and $\\mathsf{H_2}$ tokens.\n We formulate the $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of $\\mathsf{H_2O}$ with 20\\% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to $29\\times$, $29\\times$, and $3\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, $\\mathsf{H_2O}$ can reduce the latency by up to $1.9\\times$.",
