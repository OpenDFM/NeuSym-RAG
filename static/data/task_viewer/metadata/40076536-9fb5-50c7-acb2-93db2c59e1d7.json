    "abstract": "Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but\ncareful comparison between different approaches is challenging. Training is\ncomputationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,\nand, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the\nfinal results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et\nal., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and\ntraining data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can\nmatch or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best\nmodel achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results\nhighlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise\nquestions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our\nmodels and code.",
