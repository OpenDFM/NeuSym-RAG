This paper seeks to address non-native speaker variations from both a knowledge-based and a data-driven perspective. We propose to approximate non-native accented-speech pronunciation patterns by the means of two approaches: based on phonetic and phonological knowledge on the one hand and inferred from a text-to-speech system on the other. Artificial speech is then generated with a range of variants which have been captured in confusion matrices representing phoneme similarities. We then show that non-native accent confusions actually propagate to the transcription from the ASR, thus suggesting that the inference of accent specific phoneme confusions is achievable from artificial speech.\",\n}\n",
