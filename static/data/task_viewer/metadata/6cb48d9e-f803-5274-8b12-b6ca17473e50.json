    "abstract": "By design, word embeddings are unable to model the dynamic nature of words'\nsemantics, i.e., the property of words to correspond to potentially different\nmeanings. To address this limitation, dozens of specialized meaning\nrepresentation techniques such as sense or contextualized embeddings have been\nproposed. However, despite the popularity of research on this topic, very few\nevaluation benchmarks exist that specifically focus on the dynamic semantics of\nwords. In this paper we show that existing models have surpassed the\nperformance ceiling of the standard evaluation dataset for the purpose, i.e.,\nStanford Contextual Word Similarity, and highlight its shortcomings. To address\nthe lack of a suitable benchmark, we put forward a large-scale Word in Context\ndataset, called WiC, based on annotations curated by experts, for generic\nevaluation of context-sensitive representations. WiC is released in\nhttps://pilehvar.github.io/wic/.",
