The proposed scheme resolves the kernel bottleneck of previous SSA methods by utilizing 13 different types of relations. In addition, to closely collaborate with the USSA scheme, we have developed a model that includes a proposed bi-axial attention module to effectively capture the correlations among relations in the rows and columns of the table. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed framework, outperforming state-of-the-art methods consistently.\",\n}\n",
