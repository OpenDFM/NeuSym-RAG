    "abstract": "Pretrained language models, especially masked language models (MLMs) have\nseen success across many NLP tasks. However, there is ample evidence that they\nuse the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they are\ntrained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure\nsome forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic\ngroups in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark\n(CrowS-Pairs). CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing\nwith nine types of bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model\nis presented with two sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that\nis less stereotyping. The data focuses on stereotypes about historically\ndisadvantaged groups and contrasts them with advantaged groups. We find that\nall three of the widely-used MLMs we evaluate substantially favor sentences\nthat express stereotypes in every category in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building\nless biased models advances, this dataset can be used as a benchmark to\nevaluate progress.",
