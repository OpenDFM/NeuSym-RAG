    "abstract": "We propose MemoChat, a pipeline for refining instructions that enables large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to effectively employ self-composed memos for\nmaintaining consistent long-range open-domain conversations. We demonstrate a\nlong-range open-domain conversation through iterative\n\"memorization-retrieval-response\" cycles. This requires us to carefully design\ntailored tuning instructions for each distinct stage. The instructions are\nreconstructed from a collection of public datasets to teach the LLMs to\nmemorize and retrieve past dialogues with structured memos, leading to enhanced\nconsistency when participating in future conversations. We invite experts to\nmanually annotate a test set designed to evaluate the consistency of long-range\nconversations questions. Experiments on three testing scenarios involving both\nopen-source and API-accessible chatbots at scale verify the efficacy of\nMemoChat, which outperforms strong baselines. Our codes, data and models are\navailable here: https://github.com/LuJunru/MemoChat.",
