    "abstract": "Process model extraction (PME) is a recently emerged interdiscipline between\nnatural language processing (NLP) and business process management (BPM), which\naims to extract process models from textual descriptions. Previous process\nextractors heavily depend on manual features and ignore the potential relations\nbetween clues of different text granularities. In this paper, we formalize the\nPME task into the multi-grained text classification problem, and propose a\nhierarchical neural network to effectively model and extract multi-grained\ninformation without manually-defined procedural features. Under this structure,\nwe accordingly propose the coarse-to-fine (grained) learning mechanism,\ntraining multi-grained tasks in coarse-to-fine grained order to share the\nhigh-level knowledge for the low-level tasks. To evaluate our approach, we\nconstruct two multi-grained datasets from two different domains and conduct\nextensive experiments from different dimensions. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with\nstatistical significance and further investigations demonstrate its\neffectiveness.",
