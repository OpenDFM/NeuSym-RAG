    "abstract": "Logs have been widely adopted in software system development and maintenance\nbecause of the rich runtime information they record. In recent years, the\nincrease of software size and complexity leads to the rapid growth of the\nvolume of logs. To handle these large volumes of logs efficiently and\neffectively, a line of research focuses on developing intelligent and automated\nlog analysis techniques. However, only a few of these techniques have reached\nsuccessful deployments in industry due to the lack of public log datasets and\nopen benchmarking upon them. To fill this significant gap and facilitate more\nresearch on AI-driven log analytics, we have collected and released loghub, a\nlarge collection of system log datasets. In particular, loghub provides 19\nreal-world log datasets collected from a wide range of software systems,\nincluding distributed systems, supercomputers, operating systems, mobile\nsystems, server applications, and standalone software. In this paper, we\nsummarize the statistics of these datasets, introduce some practical usage\nscenarios of the loghub datasets, and present our benchmarking results on\nloghub to benefit the researchers and practitioners in this field. Up to the\ntime of this paper writing, the loghub datasets have been downloaded for\nroughly 90,000 times in total by hundreds of organizations from both industry\nand academia. The loghub datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/logpai/loghub.",
