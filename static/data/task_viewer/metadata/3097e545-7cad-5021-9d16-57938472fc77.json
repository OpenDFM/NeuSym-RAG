In this paper, we introduce a locally-attributable text generation approach, prioritizing concise attributions. Our method, named {``}Attribute First, then Generate{``}, breaks down the conventional end-to-end generation process into three intuitive steps: content selection, sentence planning, and sequential sentence generation. By initially identifying relevant source segments ({``}select first{``}) and then conditioning the generation process on them ({``}then generate{``}), we ensure these segments also act as the output{'}s fine-grained attributions ({``}select{``} becomes {``}attribute{``}). Tested on Multi-document Summarization and Long-form Question-answering, our method not only yields more concise citations than the baselines but also maintains - and in some cases enhances - both generation quality and attribution accuracy. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the time required for fact verification by human assessors.\",\n}\n",
