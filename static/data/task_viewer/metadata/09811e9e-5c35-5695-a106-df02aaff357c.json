    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), along with the recent progress in biomedical\nlanguage understanding, is gradually changing medical practice. With the\ndevelopment of biomedical language understanding benchmarks, AI applications\nare widely used in the medical field. However, most benchmarks are limited to\nEnglish, which makes it challenging to replicate many of the successes in\nEnglish for other languages. To facilitate research in this direction, we\ncollect real-world biomedical data and present the first Chinese Biomedical\nLanguage Understanding Evaluation (CBLUE) benchmark: a collection of natural\nlanguage understanding tasks including named entity recognition, information\nextraction, clinical diagnosis normalization, single-sentence/sentence-pair\nclassification, and an associated online platform for model evaluation,\ncomparison, and analysis. To establish evaluation on these tasks, we report\nempirical results with the current 11 pre-trained Chinese models, and\nexperimental results show that state-of-the-art neural models perform by far\nworse than the human ceiling. Our benchmark is released at\n\\url{https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=95414&lang=en-us}.",
