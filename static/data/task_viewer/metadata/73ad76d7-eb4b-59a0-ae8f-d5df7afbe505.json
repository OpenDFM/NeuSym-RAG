    "abstract": "The capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to comprehend\nuser intent and provide reasonable responses has made them extremely popular\nlately. In this paper, we focus on assessing the overall ability of ChatGPT\nusing 7 fine-grained information extraction (IE) tasks. Specially, we present\nthe systematically analysis by measuring ChatGPT's performance, explainability,\ncalibration, and faithfulness, and resulting in 15 keys from either the ChatGPT\nor domain experts. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT's performance in\nStandard-IE setting is poor, but it surprisingly exhibits excellent performance\nin the OpenIE setting, as evidenced by human evaluation. In addition, our\nresearch indicates that ChatGPT provides high-quality and trustworthy\nexplanations for its decisions. However, there is an issue of ChatGPT being\noverconfident in its predictions, which resulting in low calibration.\nFurthermore, ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of faithfulness to the original\ntext in the majority of cases. We manually annotate and release the test sets\nof 7 fine-grained IE tasks contains 14 datasets to further promote the\nresearch. The datasets and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/pkuserc/ChatGPT_for_IE.",
