    "abstract": "During the current mental health crisis, the importance of identifying\npotential indicators of mental issues from social media content has surged.\nOverlooking the multifaceted nature of mental and social well-being can have\ndetrimental effects on one's mental state. In traditional therapy sessions,\nprofessionals manually pinpoint the origins and outcomes of underlying mental\nchallenges, a process both detailed and time-intensive. We introduce an\napproach to this intricate mental health analysis by framing the identification\nof wellness dimensions in Reddit content as a wellness concept extraction and\ncategorization challenge. We've curated a unique dataset named WELLXPLAIN,\ncomprising 3,092 entries and totaling 72,813 words. Drawing from Halbert L.\nDunn's well-regarded wellness theory, our team formulated an annotation\nframework along with guidelines. This dataset also includes human-marked\ntextual segments, offering clear reasoning for decisions made in the wellness\nconcept categorization process. Our aim in publishing this dataset and\nanalyzing initial benchmarks is to spearhead the creation of advanced language\nmodels tailored for healthcare-focused concept extraction and categorization.",
