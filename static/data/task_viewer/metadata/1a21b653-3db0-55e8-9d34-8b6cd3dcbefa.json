    "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation is important for ensuring safety and robustness of AI\nsystems. While most research in the area has focused on un-structured\nprediction tasks, limited work has investigated general uncertainty estimation\napproaches for structured prediction. Thus, this work aims to investigate\nuncertainty estimation for autoregressive structured prediction tasks within a\nsingle unified and interpretable probabilistic ensemble-based framework. We\nconsider: uncertainty estimation for sequence data at the token-level and\ncomplete sequence-level; interpretations for, and applications of, various\nmeasures of uncertainty; and discuss both the theoretical and practical\nchallenges associated with obtaining them. This work also provides baselines\nfor token-level and sequence-level error detection, and sequence-level\nout-of-domain input detection on the WMT'14 English-French and WMT'17\nEnglish-German translation and LibriSpeech speech recognition datasets.",
