    "abstract": "Theorem proving is an important challenge for large language models (LLMs),\nas formal proofs can be checked rigorously by proof assistants such as Lean,\nleaving no room for hallucination. Existing LLM-based provers try to prove\ntheorems in a fully autonomous mode without human intervention. In this mode,\nthey struggle with novel and challenging theorems, for which human insights may\nbe critical. In this paper, we explore LLMs as copilots that assist humans in\nproving theorems. We introduce Lean Copilot, a framework for running LLM\ninference in Lean. It enables programmers to build various LLM-based proof\nautomation tools that integrate seamlessly into the workflow of Lean users.\nUsing Lean Copilot, we build tools for suggesting proof steps (tactic\nsuggestion), completing intermediate proof goals (proof search), and selecting\nrelevant premises (premise selection) using LLMs. Users can use our pretrained\nmodels or bring their own ones that run either locally (with or without GPUs)\nor on the cloud. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod in assisting humans and automating theorem proving process compared to\nexisting rule-based proof automation in Lean. We open source all codes under a\npermissive MIT license to facilitate further research.",
