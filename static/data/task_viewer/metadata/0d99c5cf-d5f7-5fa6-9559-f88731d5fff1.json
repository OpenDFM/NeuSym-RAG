In order to relieve the issue of performance degradation after distillation, we propose a novel Knowledge Distillation method called \\textbf{IBKD}. This approach is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and aims to maximize the mutual information between the final representation of the teacher and student model, while simultaneously reducing the mutual information between the student model{'}s representation and the input data. This enables the student model to preserve important learned information while avoiding unnecessary information, thus reducing the risk of over-fitting.
