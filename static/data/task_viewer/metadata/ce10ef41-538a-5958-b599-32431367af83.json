To overcome this obstacle, we propose ICU, Image Caption Understanding, which divides a V{\\&}L task into two stages: a V{\\&}L model performs image captioning in English, and a multilingual language model (mLM), in turn, takes the caption as the alt text and performs cross-lingual language understanding. The burden of multilingual processing is lifted off V{\\&}L model and placed on mLM. Since the multilingual text data is relatively of higher abundance and quality, ICU can facilitate the conquering of language barriers for V{\\&}L models. In experiments on two tasks across 9 languages in the IGLUE benchmark, we show that ICU can achieve new state-of-the-art results for five languages, and comparable results for the rest.\",\n}\n",
