{"role": "system", "content": "You are an intelligent agent with expertise in **retrieving useful context from both the DuckDB database and the Milvus vectorstore through SQL execution and similarity search** and **answering user questions**. You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.\n\n--------\n\n## Task Description\nEach task consists of the following parts:\n\n[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?\n[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is \"Yes\" or \"No\" without punctuation.\n[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.\n[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.\n[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval.\n[Database Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the DuckDB database for reference when generating SQL queries. It includes 1) tables, 2) columns and their data types, 3) descriptions for these schema items, and 4) primary key and foreign key constraints.\n[Vectorstore Schema]: A detailed serialized schema of the Milvus vectorstore for reference when generating executable retrieval actions with specific parameters. It includes 1) collections, 2) fields, 3) encodable (table, column) pairs in the relational database where the vectorized content originates, and 4) grammar for valid filter rules.\n\n\n--------\n\n## Action and Observation Space\nAll allowable action types include ['RetrieveFromDatabase', 'ClassicRetrieve', 'GenerateAnswer']. Here is the detailed specification in MARKDOWN format:\n\n### Action Type\nRetrieveFromDatabase\n\n### Description\nGenerate an SQL query to retrieve the desired information from the DuckDB database. Please refer to the concrete database schema to produce a valid and executable SQL.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the execution result of the SQL query. You do not need to worry about the actual execution, we will perform it for you. If the SQL failed to execute, we will return the error message. Extremely long SQL output will be truncated.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nRetrieveFromDatabase(sql: str)\n- sql: str, required. The concrete DuckDB SQL query to execute and retrieve results.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nGet the abstract of the paper with paper_id '12345678' from the metadata table in the DuckDB database.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT abstract FROM metadata WHERE paper_id = '12345678';\")\n\n\n#### Case 2\nFind which page in the paper with paper_id '12345678' contains Figure 3.\n\n[Action]: RetrieveFromDatabase(sql=\"SELECT pages.page_number FROM images JOIN pages JOIN metadata ON images.ref_page_id = pages.page_id AND pages.ref_paper_id = metadata.paper_id WHERE metadata.paper_id = '12345678' AND images.image_caption LIKE '%Figure 3%';\")\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nClassicRetrieve\n\n### Description\nGiven a query text, retrieve relevant context from the Milvus vectorstore.\n\n### Observation\nThe observation space is the retrieved top-ranked entries from the Milvus vectorstore based on queries.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nClassicRetrieve(query: str, limit: int = 5)\n- query: str, required. The query text will be encoded and used to search for relevant context. You can rephrase the original user question to obtain a more clear and structured query requirement.\n- limit: int, optional, default to 5. The number of top-ranked context to retrieve. Please set it to a positive integer to limit the number of returned results. Extremely large limit values may be truncated.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nRetrieve top 5 pieces about a certain topic.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query='Is there any work about the topic structured RAG?')\n\n\n#### Case 2\nRetrieve detailed information about the learning rate for training the ResNet model. The top 4 most relevant entries will be returned based on the query.\n\n[Action]: ClassicRetrieve(query=\"What's the learning rate for training the ResNet model?\", limit=4)\n\n\n----\n\n### Action Type\nGenerateAnswer\n\n### Description\nWhen you take this action, the retrieved results suffice to answer the user question. PLEASE STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ANSWER FORMAT FOR THE CURRENT QUESTION.\n\n### Observation\nThere is no observation for this terminal action, since it indicates the completion of the task and end of the interaction.\n\n### Syntax and Parameters (MARKDOWN Format)\nGenerateAnswer(answer: Any)\n- answer: Any, required. The final answer to the user question. Please adhere to the answer format for the current question.\n\n### Use Cases\n\n#### Case 1\nThe answer to the user question is 42.\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=42)\n\n\n#### Case 2\nThe answer to the user question is a list of strings: ['Results', 'Discussion'].\n\n[Action]: GenerateAnswer(answer=['Results', 'Discussion'])\n\n\n\n--------\n\n## Interaction Framework\n\nThe main interaction procedure proceeds like this:\n\n----\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process, why to take this action ...\n[Action]: ... which action to take, please strictly conform to the action specification ...\n[Observation]: ... execution results or error message after taking the action ...\n\n... # more interleaved triplets of ([Thought], [Action], [Observation])\n\n[Thought]: ... reasoning process to produce the final answer ...\n[Action]: ... the terminate action `GenerateAnswer`, there is no further observation ...\n\n----\n\nIn general, the main interaction loop consists of an interleaved of triplets ([Thought], [Action], [Observation]), except the last `GenerateAnswer` action which does not have \"[Observation]:\". You need to predict the \"[Thought]: ...\" followed by the \"[Action]: ...\" for each turn, and we will execute your action in the environment and provide the \"[Observation]: ...\" for the previous action.\n\n--------\n\n## Suggestions or Hints for Agent Interaction\n\n1. Explore multiple retrieval strategies. For example:\n- Experiment with different (table, column) pairs to extract diverse types of information.\n- Query various embedding models (collections) to find the most relevant context.\n\n2. Combine both structured and unstructured data. Concretely:\n- Use SQL queries to retrieve precise facts and structured data. Pay special attention to morphological variations in cell values.\n- Perform similarity searches in the vectorstore to capture semantic relationships and hidden insights.\n\n3. Iterate and refine:\n- If SQL execution result is not satisfactory, try alternative SQL queries to explore the database content carefully.\n- If the vector-based neural retrieval is insufficient, try alternative approaches or parameter settings.\n- Use your findings to validate or enrich the final response.\n\n4. Ensure confidence. That is, only make a final decision when you are confident that the retrieved information fully addresses the userâ€™s query.\n\n\nRemember that, for each question, you only have 20 interaction turns at most. Now, let's start!\n"}

The GPT Ranking represents the\\nlanguage model\\u2019s evaluation of the quality of the generated response. This score signifies the extent\\nto which the response aligns with the ground truth image description and answer while demonstrating\\nthe model\\u2019s language proficiency. Factors such as grammar, semantics, and fluency are taken into\\naccount when comparing the response to that of another model. It is important to note that GPT-4\\nexhibits sequence ordering bias. To mitigate this issue, we implement a dual-setting approach that\\nreverses the order of the models, ensuring that the order does not influence the outcome. The prompt\\nand evaluation procedure can be found in Figure 15.\\nReward Score\\nGiven that our dataset is automatically annotated using GPT-4, it is crucial to\\nmitigate any potential system bias during model evaluation. To this end, we incorporate human\\npreference by utilizing a reward model score as an auxiliary metric. The reward model, which assesses\\nthe human-like quality of a response, is trained using human feedback to predict the superiority of a\\ngenerated answer in relation to a given question from a human perspective [1]. This approach allows\\nus to achieve a more balanced and robust evaluation process, ensuring that our model\\u2019s performance\\naligns with human expectations and preferences.\\n7\\n4.2\\nMain Results\\n4.2.1\\nVOILA Exhibits a Balanced Capability Between Helpfulness and Fact Grounding\\nFigure 5: GPT-RANKING ON VOILA-COCO-Testset\\nIn Figure 5, we observe a notable su-\\nperiority of VOILA over both Otter\\nand Kosmos-2 on the VOILA-COCO-\\nTESTSET. Regarding the grounding\\ncapability, both VOILA and Kosmos-\\n2 trained with fine-grained grounded\\nfacts outperform Otter model to a\\nlarge extent.\\nBesides, VOILA sur-\\npasses Kosmos-2 marginally. With\\nrespect to helpful capability, Otter de-\\nlivers significantly more helpful re-\\nsponses than Kosmos-2. Since Otter is trained on top of Openflamingo with an instruction-following\\ndataset, it can provide a more helpful response, especially for informative queries while Kosmos-2\\ntends to answer visual observation from the input image. In addition, VOILA trained on gaze dataset\\ndemonstrates stronger helpful capabilities over all models.\\nFigure 6: GPT-RANKING ON VOILA-GAZE\\nIn real gaze scenarios, as illustrated\\nin Figure 6, VOILA outperforms the\\ntwo baseline models as well. These\\nscenarios differ substantially from the\\ncollected COCO images and present\\nmore challenging questions, necessi-\\ntating a higher degree of accurate in-\\ntent understanding and reasoning. Es-\\npecially from the comparison of Otter\\nvs Kosmos-2, we found that there are\\nmany more Tie results due to the hard-\\nness of the real cases. Despite these\\nincreased demands, VOILA continues\\nto surpass both models, further showcasing its balanced proficiency in both helpfulness and fact\\ngrounding.\\n4.3\\nAblation studies\\n4.3.1\\nQuery types has a significant impact on Response Quality\\nTable 2: Ablation on query types, WR means Winning Rate\\nOver Otter-base\\nMETHODS\\nQUESTION TYPES\\nWR\\nLR\\nREWARD SCORE\\nOTTER-BASE\\nCOREFERENCE QUERY\\n-\\n-\\n-1.91\\nOTTER-BASE\\nDIRECT QUERY\\n0.51\\n0.1\\n0.02\\nVOILA\\nCOREFERENCE QUERY\\n0.41\\n0.18\\n-0.79\\nVOILA\\nDIRECT QUERY\\n0.62\\n0.15\\n0.14\\nVOILA\\nIN-CONTEXT PROMPT + COREFERENCE QUERY\\n0.46\\n0.16\\n-0.02\\nVOILA\\nIN-CONTEXT PROMPT + DIRECT QUERY\\n0.77\\n0.12\\n0.20\\nTable 2 investigates the varying per-\\nformance of different question types,\\nspecifically direct and implicit\\/coref-\\nerence queries. As the base model\\nOpenflamingo was pre-trained on di-\\nrect queries, both Otter and VOILA\\nperformed better in this category, as\\nexpected. In addition, it is natural for\\nhumans to communicate with coref-\\nerence queries. VOILA maintained\\nstrong performance when handling coreference queries with the gaze as guidance while the Otter\\nmodel greatly decreased. Furthermore, we appended in-context QA pairs prior to the current query\\nand observed that the examples further improved the quality of the responses. In real-life situations,\\nmulti-turn conversations are involved in most interactions with many coreference queries. The design\\nof an in-context prompt can assist VOILA to demonstrate a superior ability. This improvement is\\nevident across both direct and coreference query types.\\n4.3.2\\nHeatmap is a better way to incorporate gaze\\n8\\nTable 3: Ablation on Methods of Integrating Gaze Data, WR\\nmeans Wining Rate over Otter-base\\nMETHODS\\nWR\\nLR\\nREWARD SCORE\\nOTTER-BASE\\n-\\n-\\n-1.91\\nGAZE AS DISCRETE POSITION TOKENS\\n0.19\\n0.25\\n-2.44\\nGAZE bounding box AS IMAGE PATCH\\n0.36\\n0.20\\n-1.26\\nGAZE bounding box AS DISCRETE POSITION TOKENS\\n0.21\\n0.22\\n-1.72\\nVOILA(GAZE AS HEATMAP)\\n0.41\\n0.18\\n-0.79\\nTo establish the effectiveness of our\\napproach, we implemented several\\nalternative methods for incorporat-\\ning gaze data into VLMs.\\nThese\\nmethods include: converting gaze se-\\nquences into discrete position tokens\\nfor LLMs, using the bounding box\\nposition of trace trajectories as addi-\\ntional patch tokens concatenated to\\nVIT image feature token lists, and con-\\nverting the bounding box coordinates into discrete tokens. We illustrate these methods in Figure 16.\\nHowever, all these methods failed to outperform the gaze heatmap approach, as shown in Table 3.\\n4.3.3\\nGradual Unfreezing of Parameters Yields Better Results\\nTable 4: Ablation on Training Procedure, WR means Wining\\nRate over Otter-base\\nLAYERS FINE-TUNED\\nWR\\nLR\\nREWARD SCORE\\nOTTER-BASE FROZEN ALL\\n-\\n-\\n-1.91\\nOTTER-BASE VISION PERCEIVER+CROSS ATTENTION\\n0.25\\n0.24\\n-1.78\\nVOILA GAZE WEIGHT\\n0.24\\n0.20\\n-1.52\\nVOILA GAZE WEIGHT+LORA\\n0.23\\n0.21\\n-1.02\\nVOILA GAZE WEIGHT\\u279dPERCIEVER+CROSS ATTENTION\\n0.41\\n0.18\\n-0.79\\nTable 4 presents empirical findings\\nthat demonstrate the effectiveness of\\ngradually unfreezing model param-\\neters.\\nInstead of directly unfreez-\\ning the vision perceiver and cross-\\nattention layers, or using LORA to\\nfine-tune the entire model, we first\\nfine-tuned the gaze-related weights\\nand then fine-tuned the other parts of\\nthe perceiver and cross-attention lay-\\ners, which yielded better results. We hypothesize that this improvement is due to the newly added\\ngaze component needing to adapt to the distribution of the pre-trained layers first. This adaptation\\nprocess can further help mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting.\\n4.4\\nQualitative studies\\nWe conducted qualitative studies on randomly selected cases and demonstrated the results of several\\nrepresentative examples in Appendix Figure 8.

This\\nrequires further context or generates the answer based on the salient object like plane instead of the\\nactual human attention; 3) The Kosmos-2 model can take the bounding box for grounding as spatial\\nguidance, it is sometimes not accurate compared to the heatmap used in VOILA. As shown in the\\n3rd row, the bounding box is too coarse and made the model focus on the object plane instead of the\\nactual human attention sky; 4) Besides, we found that Kosmos-2 tends to describe the detailed visual\\ncontent and sometimes lacks the instruction-following capability; In the 4th row, the Kosmos-2\\nresponses Keyboard depicted in the bounding box ignoring the actual query intention; Finally, 5)\\nThere are still further challenges for all models to deal with.
