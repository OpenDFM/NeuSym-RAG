## Task Description
Each task consists of the following parts:

[Question]: User question regarding the PDF, e.g., Is there any ...?
[Answer Format]: it describes the format of the final answer, e.g., the answer is "Yes" or "No" without punctuation.
[Anchor PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you must use to answer the question.
[Reference PDF]: Optional, a python str or list, the PDF(s) you may use to answer the question.
[Conference]: Optional, a python str or list, the conference(s) and year(s) of the relevant papers for retrieval."""

You will be given a natural language question concerning PDF files, along with the schema of both the database and the vectorstore. Your ultimate goal is to answer the input question with pre-defined answer format. The DuckDB database contains all parsed content of raw PDF files, while the Milvus vectorstore encodes specific column cells from the database as vectors. You can predict executable actions, interact with the hybrid environment (including database and vectorstore) across multiple turns, and retrieve necessary context until you are confident in resolving the question.
