As for the second peak,\nits intensity decreases if the frequency increases.

            "A dielectric relaxation is observed for real and imagin-\nary parts of the dielectric permittivity for the C0 and C2\nsamples near −50 °C caused by reorientation of the cel-\nlulose methyl groups on the micro/nanocellulose crystal-\nlite surface via changing their conformation from tg\ntoward tt. At a higher oxide concentration (C3 sample),\ndielectric relaxation disappeared (see ε′(T) and ε″(T)\ndependencies in Fig. 7). We can conclude that oxide\nparticles block methyl groups’ conformation movement\non the cellulose micro/nanocrystallite surface.",
            "Luminescence Properties",
            "All the studied samples are characterized with intensive\nphotoluminescence (PL). The composed PL band consists\nof at least three components lying in the 325–750-nm\nrange (Fig. 8, [11]). The PL had been observed both in the\nPL spectra of the starting microcellulose, SC, and the un-",

            "doped C0 samples under excitation in the wide range of\nexcitation wavelengths, λex, from 300 up to 550 nm. The\nshape, peak position, λmax, and intensity of the PL band\ndepend on the λex that had been found by us previously\nfor the similar samples [10, 11]. The spectra and their de-\npendencies on the λex are similar for the mentioned sam-\nples: λex increases as the peak position, λmax, reveals a\ntendency to the long-wavelength-side shifting. Mainly, the\ncomponent with a peak position near 430–470 nm domi-\nnates in the spectra at UV excitation, while at the visible\nlaser power excitation (λex = 405–532 nm), an additional\nlow-intensity PL band appears. The band is located at lon-\nger wavelengths, range 500–700 nm, than that of the UV\nexcitation. The peak position of the band, λmax, is near\n680–590 nm (Fig. 8a) [11].",
            "When the SC and C0 samples underwent the thermal\ntreatment, the PL spectra changed but these changes are\nsmall if the treatment temperature, Ttr, is lower than\n230 °C (Fig. 9). Only some decrease of the short-\nwavelength side of the spectra takes place. At the same"

            "time, the PL intensity changes and this change is not\nmonotonous: intensity increases when Ttr increases up\nto 200 °C, then the PL intensity rapidly decreases\n(Fig. 9b).",
            "The luminescence peculiarities of the cellulose sam-\nples described above are similar to those reported earlier\n(see, e.g., [27]). The luminescent findings presented here\nproved that there is more than one luminescence center\nin the studied cellulose samples. The multicomponent\nstructure of the PL bands is usually related to the mani-\nfestation of several types of organic chromophores, and\nthose are in the host cellulose. Carbonyl groups and dif-\nferent kinds of low-molecular derivatives of cellulose de-\nstruction are between them. The nonmonotonous\nbehavior of the host cellulose PL intensity observed by\nus can be related with the resorption of some ambient\natmosphere components and particularly with water re-\nmoval. The mentioned factor has to lead to lumines-\ncence enhancement when the treatment temperature\nincreases up to 200 °C. If treatment temperature is\nhigher than 200 °C, structural changes of the micro/\nnanocellulose host occur that leads to luminescence\nquenching.",
            "Taking into account the abovementioned items, we\nunderstand that incorporation of oxide compounds must\nchange the PL properties of the micro/nanocellulose\nhost (Fig. 9). The PL spectra of the C1, C2, and C3 com-\nposites are shown in Fig. 9.",
            "It is seen that if the amount of oxide is low (C1 sample),\nthe PL of the host cellulose prevails in the spectra. In fact,\nthe C1 spectrum is very similar to the spectra shown in\nFig. 8b. Nevertheless, the low-intensity PL lines can be\nseen in the spectral range 550–700 nm both for the C1\nand C2 samples. When the oxide concentration is higher\n(C3 sample), significant changes are observed: narrow\nlines become more intensive than host micro/nanocellu-\nlose luminescence, and moreover, the cellulose PL inten-\nsity decreases. No doubt the additive PL lines are related\nwith luminescence processes in the oxide component of\nthe composites. A comparison of described spectra with\nthe PL spectra of the free powder K2Eu(MoO4)(PO4) com-\npounds confirms this statement (Fig. 9). So, the PL lines\nare ascribed to the 5D0→7FJ (J = 1 ÷ 4) radiation transi-\ntions in the inner f-f electronic shells of the Eu3+ ions\nwhich are in the composition of the oxide compound.\nQuenching of the cellulose host PL, when the amount of\nthe oxide component increases, can be caused by the\ndestroying effect of the oxide micro/nanoparticles on the\nmorphology and structure of the COM/NC material, as\nwe already have pointed out above. So, the PL characteris-\ntic behavior also indicates an interaction between the\ncellulose host and oxide component of the composite\nmaterial.",
            "Conclusions",
            "Composite materials that consist of micro/nanocellulose\nand complex K2Eu(MoO4)(PO4) luminescent oxide par-\nticles were made using mechanical dispersion and\nfollowed high pressing (1.8 × 104 kPa/m2).",
            "The structure of the composite without oxide is\nformed by grains of nearly 5–50 μm in size (crystallinity\nis about ~56%), which allowed us to characterize the made\nsamples as ceramics-like. Structure of the micro/nanocel-\nlulose samples which contain an oxide particle is similar,\nbut the cellulose grains are deformed by oxide particles.\nThe sizes of the last ones are from ~10 nm up to 10 μm.",
            "Physical properties of studied materials (density, crys-\ntallinity, relative extension, thermal extension coefficient,\ndielectric relaxation parameters, spectra, and intensity of\nphotoluminescence) depend both on the sample tem-\nperature (conditions of the thermal treatment) in the\nrange 25–125 °C and content of oxide component.",
            "It was assumed that the difference in oxide particle\nsize distribution for the samples of various oxide con-\ncentration and molecules of water (~0.3–0.5%) deter-\nmine the complexity of the abovementioned property\ndependencies on temperature and oxide content."
