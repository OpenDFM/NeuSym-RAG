Presence of Multiple Aspects: Social media posts often express feelings due to various reasons. To address this, specific text spans contributing to the more focused health consequences can be identified and associated with corresponding wellness dimensions. 2. Annotation Ambiguity: Although there may be multiple aspects in the post, we must consider the holistic aspect as per the experts' opinion. 3. Reading between the lines: The text may contain implicit or subtle hints that suggest a particular wellness dimension. But clear and meaningful words that suggest one of the four wellness dimensions should be annotated accordingly.",
