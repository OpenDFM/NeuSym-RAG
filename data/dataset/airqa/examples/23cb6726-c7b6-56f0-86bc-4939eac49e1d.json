The ground-truth loss is to use one-hot labels to predict connectives, and LKD is the knowledge distillation loss utilizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence to quantify the difference of output distribution from student's soft predictions to teacher's soft labels, which means the student model S is required to match not only the groundtruth one-hot labels but also the probability outputs of the teacher model T.",
