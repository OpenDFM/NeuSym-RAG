    "question": "According to Table 2 in the paper \"ACT-SQL: In-Context Learning for Text-to-SQL with Automatically-Generated Chain-of-Thought\", how many times does the LLM's API need to be called to generate a SQL query in the DIN-SQL approach? What modules in the DIN-SQL approach lead to those API calls?",
    "answer_format": "Your answer should be a Python list like [integer, string1, string2, ...]. The first element should be an integer, representing the number of times the LLM's API needs to be called. Each subsequent element should be a string, representing a module name in the DIN-SQL approach. Note that the module names do not need to include the word \"module\".",
