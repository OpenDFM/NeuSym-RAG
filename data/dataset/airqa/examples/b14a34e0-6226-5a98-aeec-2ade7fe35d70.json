One anchor picture corresponded to the lowest rating (e.g, the very darkest rock), a second anchor picture corresponded to the highest rating (e.g, the very lightest rock), and a third anchor corresponded to a rock that we judged to be roughly average on the rated dimension (e.g., a rock of average darkness/lightness). The anchors and scale values were displayed at the bottom of the screen throughout the rating session to ensure the objectivity and fairness of the ratings.",
