The goal of the equation is to compute a value proportional to the posterior probability $p(x | \\{y_l, l \\in L\\})$. Since $p(\\{y_l, l \\in L\\})$ does not depend on $x$, it remains the same for all possible ancestral forms and thus does not affect the relative probabilities of different $x$ values.",
