The results of the aforementioned models are reported in Table 9 with the following observations. First, comparing our approach (in Table 3) with the 'ALL' and the 'RANDOM' baselines, our approach achieves better performance, which complies with our intuition because that 'ALL' and 'RANDOM' actually do not select experts to process the input features and thus face problems of utilizing inappropriate experts to process the essential content of the dialogue, which introduces noise that leads to inferior results. Second, when the role information is not included in the router, the model's performance is also worse than our full model, which indicates that the role information is important to understand the key content of dialogue as we hypothesized in our motivation, so that it helps the router to better associate some contents to particular speakers and perform appropriate expert selection",
