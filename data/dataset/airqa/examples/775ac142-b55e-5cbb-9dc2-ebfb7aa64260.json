Traditional metrics often fail to assess the new information a rationale provides beyond what is already present in the input or label.",

It evaluates rationales along two dimensions: (1) Support for the Label: Whether the rationale helps predict the intended label; (2) New Information Contribution: How much unique information the rationale adds, beyond the input and label, to justify the prediction"
