The learned embeddings occupy a narrow cone in the vector space, which largely limits their expressiveness. Researches find that language models trained with tied input/output embeddings lead to anisotropic word embeddings, and the singular values of the word embedding matrix decay drastically. In other words, except for a few dominating singular values, all others are close to zero.",
