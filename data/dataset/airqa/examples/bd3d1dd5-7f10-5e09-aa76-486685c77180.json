            "reference_answer": "Formula (2) to (4) describe the self-contrastive training (SELFCONT) algorithm, which is designed to mitigate the repetition problem in language models. SELFCONT modifies the training process by adding a penalty to the output of the current model \\(f_{\theta_1}\\) when it predicts a repetitive token that the premature checkpoint \\(f_{\theta_0}\\) also predicts. The penalty is controlled by the weight \\(w\\), which is only active when the true next token is non-repetitive but the premature model predicts it as repetitive. This encourages the model to learn more complex patterns and reduce its tendency to generate repetitive text.",
