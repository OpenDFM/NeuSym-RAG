                "Rolling Buffer Cache. A fixed attention span means that mistral-7B can limit our cache size using a rolling buffer cache. The cache has a fixed size of W , and the keys and values for the timestep i are stored in position i mod W of the cache. As a result, when the position i is larger than W , past values in the cache are overwritten, and the size of the cache stops increasing.",

If the prompt is very large, we can chunk it into smaller pieces, and pre-fill the cache with each chunk. For this purpose, we can select the window size as our chunk size. For each chunk, mistral-7B thus need to compute the attention over the cache and over the chunk."
