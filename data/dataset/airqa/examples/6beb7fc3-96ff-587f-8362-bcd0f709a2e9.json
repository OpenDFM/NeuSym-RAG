            "reference_answer": "The system adapts to completely unfamiliar opponent policies by collecting and accumulating opponent trajectory data in an Opponent-Collecting Window (OCW), which is then sampled and stitched together using the GetOnD function for in-context learning. For known policies, the system quickly re-engages suitable responses by leveraging previously accumulated trajectories, ensuring both fast adaptation to familiar policies and effective extrapolation for unfamiliar ones."
