Teams are expected to develop models that predict the empathy score for each essay (self-report data from the essay writer). Both empathy and distress scores are real values between 1 and 7. Empathy score is an average of 7-point scale ratings, representing each of the following states (warm, tender, sympathetic, softhearted, moved, compassionate); distress score is an average of 7-point scale ratings, representing each of the following states (worried, upset, troubled, perturbed, grieved, disturbed, alarmed, distressed). These are state measures: measures that vary within people across time. The formulation of track3 is to predict, for each essay, one or more emotion labels from the following Ekman's six basic emotions (sadness, joy, disgust, surprise, anger, or fear) as well as neutral, and we also added hope.",
