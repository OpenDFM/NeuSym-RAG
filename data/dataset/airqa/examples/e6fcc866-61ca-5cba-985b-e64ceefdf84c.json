            "reference_answer": "1. Transformation, which modifies the distribution of weights and activations to reduce outliers using techniques like scaling-based transformations (e.g., AWQ, SmoothQuant) and rotation-based methods (e.g., QuaRot); 2. Clipping, which limits extreme weight values through symmetric or asymmetric methods to manage outliers that impact quantization; 3. Reconstruction, which minimizes quantization error by iteratively adjusting unquantized weights, as exemplified by GPTQ, to closely replicate original model outputs."
