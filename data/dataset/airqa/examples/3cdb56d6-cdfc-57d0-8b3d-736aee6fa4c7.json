            "reference_answer": "To initialize $h_{i,0}^S$ in Equation (11), we start with the output from Equation (8): $h_i^S = \\hat{h}_i + s_i$.\n\nHere, $\\hat{h}_i$ is the output from the Aspect-Aware Attention Module (A3M), and $s_i$ is the sentiment feature obtained by projecting the affective score of word $w_i$ from SenticNet into the same dimensional space as $\\hat{h}_i$. Specifically:\n\n1. For each word $w_i$ in the sentence, obtain its affective score $w_i^S$ from SenticNet.\n2. Project this affective score into the same dimensional space as $\\hat{h}_i$: $s_i = W_S w_i^S + b_S$, where $W_S$ and $b_S$ are learned parameters.\n3. Add the sentiment feature $s_i$ to $\\hat{h}_i$: $h_i^S = \\hat{h}_i + s_i$\n\nThis $h_i^S$ serves as the initial node representation $h_{i,0}^S$ for the Aspect-Guided Graph Convolutional Network (AG-GCN). Therefore, for the first layer $l=0$: $h_{i,0}^S = h_i^S$.",
