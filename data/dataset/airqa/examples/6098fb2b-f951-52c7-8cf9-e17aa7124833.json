                "Equation (1) is used in single-vector retrieval models. It calculates the similarity score $s(q, d)$ as the dot product between the encoded vector of the query $v_q = \\eta_Q(q)$ and the encoded vector of the document $v_d = \\eta_D(d)$. In this method, the entire query and the entire document are each represented by a single vector, and their similarity is determined by the cosine of the angle between these two vectors. This approach does not consider token-level interactions, as all token embeddings are pooled into a single vector before the similarity score is computed.",
                "Equation (2) is used in multi-vector retrieval models, specifically in ColBERT. It calculates the similarity score by considering the interaction between each token in the query and each token in the document. The similarity score $s(q, d)$ is defined as $s(q, d) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\max_{j} v_{qi}^T v_{dj}$, where $v_{qi}$ and $v_{dj}$ are the last-layer contextualized token embeddings of BERT for the i-th token in the query and the j-th token in the document, respectively. This operation, known as MaxSim, exhaustively compares each query token to all document tokens, effectively capturing the most relevant token-level interactions."
