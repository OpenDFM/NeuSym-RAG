            "reference_answer": "The authors of \"What Algorithms can Transformers Learn? A Study in Length Generalization\" provide empirical evidence by demonstrating that transformers exhibit strong length generalization on tasks such as parity and addition when these tasks can be represented by short RASP programs. They show that by leveraging the RASP framework, transformers can generalize to sequences longer than those seen during training, supporting the conjecture that the simplicity of the RASP representation correlates with successful length generalization."
