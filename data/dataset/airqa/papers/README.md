## Papers Collection in 2023 and 2024

- For duplicate papers in one conference year, we only retain one version and randomly assign it to one workshop or volume, e.g.,
    - papers that appear both in findings and workshops in ACL/EMNLP,
    - papers that exist in more than one ICLR/NeurIPS workshops.
- For ACL or EMNLP, we exclude PDF files that introduce the program committee, e.g., "[Proceedings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.0/)".
- For NeurIPS or ICLR, we only process accepted papers that have open access PDF URLs, and exclude blog post and rejected submissions (`blog` not in `venue.lower()`, `reject` not in `venue.lower()` and `submitted to` not in `venue.lower()`).
- For ICASSP, we only maintain papers whose PDF files are printable and parsable.
