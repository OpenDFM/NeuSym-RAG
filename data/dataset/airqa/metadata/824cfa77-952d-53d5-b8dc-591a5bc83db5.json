Previous research has found that these models often generate summaries that are inconsistent with their context document and contain nonfactual information. To evaluate factuality in document summarization, a document-level Natural Language Inference (NLI) classifier can be used. However, training such a classifier requires large-scale high-quality factual and nonfactual samples. To that end, we introduce NonFactS, a data generation model, to synthesize nonfactual summaries given a context document and a human-annotated (reference) factual summary. Compared to previous methods, our nonfactual samples are more abstractive and more similar to their corresponding factual samples, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on two factuality evaluation benchmarks, FALSESUM and SUMMAC. Our experiments demonstrate that even without human-annotated summaries, NonFactS can use random sentences to generate nonfactual summaries and a classifier trained on these samples generalizes to out-of-domain documents.\",\n}\n",
