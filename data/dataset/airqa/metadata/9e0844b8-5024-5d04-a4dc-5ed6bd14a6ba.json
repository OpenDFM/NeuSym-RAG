Recently, various methods based on contrastive learning have been proposed to learn textual representations from unlabelled data; by maximizing alignment between minimally-perturbed embeddings of the same text, and encouraging a uniform distribution of embeddings across a broader corpus. Differently, we propose maximizing alignment between texts and a composition of their phrasal constituents. We consider several realizations of this objective and elaborate the impact on representations in each case. Experimental results on semantic textual similarity tasks show improvements over baselines that are comparable with state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, this work is the first to do so without incurring costs in auxiliary training objectives or additional network parameters.\",\n}\n",
