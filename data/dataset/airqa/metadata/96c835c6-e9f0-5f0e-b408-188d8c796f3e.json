We developed different deep-learning models for each sub-tasks. For RR, we developed a multi- task learning model with contextual sequential sentence classification as the main task and non- contextual single sentence prediction as the sec- ondary task. Our model achieved an F1-score of 76.50{\\%} on the unseen test set, and we at- tained the 14th position on the leaderboard. For the L-NER problem, we have designed a hybrid model, consisting of a multi-stage knowledge transfer learning framework and a rule-based system. This model achieved an F1-score of 91.20{\\%} on the blind test set and attained the top position on the final leaderboard. Finally, for the CJPE task, we used a hierarchical ap- proach and could get around 66.67{\\%} F1-score on judgment prediction and 45.83{\\%} F1-score on the explainability of the CJPE task, and we attained 8th position on the leaderboard for this sub-task.\",\n}\n",
