Modern text summarization models generate highly fluent but often factually inconsistent outputs, which has received heightened attention in recent research.

In this paper, we propose a cross-lingual factuality dataset by collecting human annotations of reference summaries as well as generated summaries from models at both summary level and sentence level. Furthermore, we perform the fine-grained analysis and observe that over 50{\\%} of generated summaries and over 27{\\%} of reference summaries contain factual errors with characteristics different from monolingual summarization. Existing evaluation metrics for monolingual summarization require translation to evaluate the factuality of cross-lingual summarization and perform differently at different tasks and levels. Finally, we adapt the monolingual factuality metrics as an initial step towards the automatic evaluation of summarization factuality in cross-lingual settings.
