    "abstract": "Religious hymns represent a particularly complex literary domain, due to their specialized registry and context, which remain understudied in computational linguistics, especially in less-resourced languages. We introduce GoldenHymns(S), a novel dataset of Danish historical religious hymns (1798–1873). To allow for a comparison with existing NLP tools’ performances, the GoldenHymns(S) dataset is enriched with modernized Danish versions as well as English translations of the hymns. To further the study of sentiment changes in Danish religious texts - a particularly relevant aspect of their development - we also provide verselevel valence annotations by human experts, and we examine the effect of language change and specificity on the performance of contemporary Danish sentiment analysis tools. The dataset is the first resource for evaluating and enhancing the performance of sentiment analysis within the realm of historical religious poetry in the Danish language.",
