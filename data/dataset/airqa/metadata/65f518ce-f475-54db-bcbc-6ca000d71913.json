However, these methods require expert knowledge, ignore contextual features, and have error propagation. Therefore, we propose a joint morphological tagger for low-resource agglutinative languages to alleviate the above challenges. First, we represent the contextual input with multi-dimensional features of agglutinative words. Second, joint training reduces the direct impact of part-of-speech errors on morphological features and increases the indirect influence between the two types of labels through a fusion mechanism. Finally, our model separately predicts part-of-speech and morphological features. Part-of-speech tagging is regarded as sequence tagging. When predicting morphological features, two-label adjacency graphs are dynamically reconstructed by integrating multilingual global features and monolingual local features. Then, a graph convolution network is used to learn the higher-order intersection of labels. A series of experiments show that the proposed model in this paper is superior to other comparative models.\",\n}\n",
