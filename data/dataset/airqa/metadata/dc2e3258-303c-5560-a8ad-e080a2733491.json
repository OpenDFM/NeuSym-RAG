In line with previous research, we devise a prompt that, on the one hand, instructs the model to generate realistic examples based on the gold standard dataset and, on the other hand, to assign multiple pseudo-labels (or a single pseudo-label) to the generated instances. We then augment our gold standard data with the generated examples and evaluate the impact thereof in a cross-validation setting with several state-of-the-art Dutch large language models. This augmentation technique predominantly shows improvements in F1 for classifying underrepresented classes while increasing the overall recall, paired with a slight decrease in precision for more common classes. Furthermore, we examine how well the synthetic data generalises to human data in the classification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilise Chat-GPT and GPT-3.5 for augmenting a Dutch multi-label dataset classification task.\",\n}\n",
