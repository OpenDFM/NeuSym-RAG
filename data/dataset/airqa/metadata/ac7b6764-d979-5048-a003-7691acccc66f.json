Recognizing the limitations of open-source models like Llama in evaluative tasks, we introduce InstructEval, a general multi-aspect text evaluator developed through instruction tuning of open-source LLMs. To overcome the shortage of annotated resources for multi-aspect evaluations, InstructEval combines extensive open Human Preference Modeling (HPM) datasets with a small set of multi-aspect annotated data.This approach not only enhances effectiveness in overall evaluation tasks but also exhibits improved performance in multi-aspect evaluation tasks.As demonstrated by our extensive experiments, InstructEval achieves comparable or superior performance to commercial LLMs like ChatGPT or GPT-4 in terms of both overall and multi-aspect evaluation.\",\n}\n",
