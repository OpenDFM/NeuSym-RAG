We reproduce a recently proposed zero-shot control method and find that it is only successful on a subset of models. To understand what causes the difference in its effectiveness, we perform a set of controlled experiments, varying only the pre-training objective, and find unexpected interactions between the pre-training method and downstream controllability of models after fine-tuning. Our results show that different pre-training objectives have consequences that may not be visible in standard downstream evaluation, but which should be taken into account when developing models with controllability in mind.\",\n}\n",
