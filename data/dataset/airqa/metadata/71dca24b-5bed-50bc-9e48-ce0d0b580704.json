We define fine-grained factual error detection as a sentence-level multi-label classification problem, and weevaluate two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on our dataset. Both models yield sub-optimal results, with a macro-averaged F1 score of around 0.25 over 6 error classes. We further propose an unsupervised model ENDERANKER via candidate ranking using pretrained encoder-decoder models. Our model performs on par with the SOTA models while requiring fewer resources. These observations confirm the challenges in detecting factual errors from dialogue summaries, which call for further studies, for which our dataset and results offer a solid foundation.\",\n}\n",
