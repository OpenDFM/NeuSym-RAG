To achieve this, we construct a model with multiple codebooks of VQ-VAE employing continuous and discrete latent variables during word generation. We evaluate the model{'}s performance under high and low-resource scenarios, and use probing techniques to examine encoded information in latent representations.

Our results demonstrate our model{'}s ability to distinguish word structures into lemmas and suffixes, with each codebook specialized for different morphological features, contributing to the interpretability of our model and effectively performing morphological inflection on both seen and unseen morphological features.\",\n}\n",
