Real-life dialogues often involve naturally occurring variations (e.g., repetitions, hesitations). In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of such variations on state-of-the-art open dialogue summarization models whose details are publicly known (e.g., architectures, weights, and training corpora). To simulate real-life variations, we introduce two types of perturbations: utterance-level perturbations that modify individual utterances with errors and language variations, and dialogue-level perturbations that add non-informative exchanges (e.g., repetitions, greetings). We perform our analysis along three dimensions of robustness: consistency, saliency, and faithfulness, which aim to capture different aspects of performance of a summarization model. We find that both fine-tuned and instruction-tuned models are affected by input variations, with the latter being more susceptible, particularly to dialogue-level perturbations. We also validate our findings via human evaluation. Finally, we investigate whether the robustness of fine-tuned models can be improved by training them with a fraction of perturbed data. We find that this approach does not yield consistent performance gains, warranting further research. Overall, our work highlights robustness challenges in current open encoder-decoder summarization models and provides insights for future research.\",\n}\n",
