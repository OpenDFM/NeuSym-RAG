Our systems are based on Lost, a variation of linear Conditional Random Fields initially developed as a probabilistic translation model and then adapted to the glossing task. This model allows us to handle one of the main challenges posed by glossing, i.e. the fact that the list of potential labels for lexical morphemes is not fixed in advance and needs to be extended dynamically when labelling units are not seen in training. In such situations, we show how to make use of candidate lexical glosses found in the translation and discuss how such extension affects the training and inference procedures. The resulting automatic glossing systems prove to yield very competitive results, especially in low-resource settings.\",\n}\n",
