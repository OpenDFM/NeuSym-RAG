Our approach demonstrates superior performance on the CoVoST-2 benchmark and showcases exceptional scaling capabilities powered by LLMs.We believe this effective method will serve as a strong baseline for speech translation and provide insights for futureimprovements of the LLM-based speech translation framework.\",\n}\n",
