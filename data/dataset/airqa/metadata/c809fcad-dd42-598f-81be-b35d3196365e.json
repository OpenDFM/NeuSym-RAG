In particular, our approach iteratively converts the explainable models{'} outputs to rules and applies them to unlabeled text to produce new annotations. Our evaluation on the TACRED dataset shows that our method outperforms the rule-based model we started from by 15 F1 points, outperforms traditional self-training that relies just on the relation classifier by 5 F1 points, and performs comparatively with the prompt-based approach of CITATION (without requiring an additional natural language inference component).\",\n}\n",
