To solve this intrinsic problem, we propose a scale-invariant infinite hierarchical topic model (ihLDA). The ihLDA adaptively adjusts the topic creation to make the expected topic probability decay considerably slower than that in existing models. Thus, it facilitates the estimation of deeper topic structures encompassing diverse topics in a corpus. Furthermore, the ihLDA extends a widely used tree-structured prior (Adams et al., 2010) in a hierarchical Bayesian way, which enables drawing an infinite topic tree from the base tree while efficiently sampling the topic assignments for the words. Experiments demonstrate that the ihLDA has better topic uniqueness and hierarchical diversity thanexisting approaches, including state-of-the-art neural models.\",\n}\n",
