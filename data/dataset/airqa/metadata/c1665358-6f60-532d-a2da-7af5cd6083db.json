We discover that data utilization efficiency in low-resource scenarios can be enhanced by mining alignment information uncertain utterance and deterministic dialogue state. Therefore, we innovatively implement dual learning in task-oriented dialogues to exploit the correlation of heterogeneous data. In addition, the one-to-one duality is converted into a multijugate duality to reduce the influence of spurious correlations in dual training for generalization.
