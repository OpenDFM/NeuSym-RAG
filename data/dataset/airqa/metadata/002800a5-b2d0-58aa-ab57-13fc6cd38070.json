We propose a methodology that leverages contrastive training to overcome this limitation. We also augmented the data with several dialects using a translation model. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our approach in capturing linguistic nuances across different Arabic dialects as well as accurately differentiating between banking intents across diverse linguistic landscapes. This would enhance multi-dialect banking services in the Arab world with limited Arabic language resources.
