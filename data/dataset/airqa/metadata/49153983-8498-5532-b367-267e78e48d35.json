Direct secondary fine-tuning with data containing new knowledge may be ineffective in updating knowledge due to the conflict between old and new knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for fine-tuning called F-Learning (Forgetting before Learning), which employs parametric arithmetic to facilitate the forgetting of old knowledge and learning of new knowledge. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed F-Learning can obviously improve the knowledge updating performance of both full fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning, simultaneously outperforming the existing baselines in most cases. Moreover, we have also discovered that forgetting old knowledge by subtracting the parameters of LoRA can yield a similar effect to subtracting the parameters of full fine-tuning, and occasionally even surpass it significantly.\",\n}\n",
