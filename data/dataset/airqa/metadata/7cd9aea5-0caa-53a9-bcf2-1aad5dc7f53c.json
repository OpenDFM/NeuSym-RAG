In this work, we aim to improve an existing product categorization model that is already in use by a major web company, serving multiple applications. At its core, the product categorization model is a text classification model that takes a product title as an input and outputs the most suitable category out of thousands of available candidates. Upon a closer inspection, we found inconsistencies in the labeling of similar items. For example, minor modifications of the product title pertaining to colors or measurements majorly impacted the model{'}s output. This phenomenon can negatively affect downstream recommendation or search applications, leading to a sub-optimal user experience. To address this issue, we propose a new framework for consistent text categorization. Our goal is to improve the model{'}s consistency while maintaining its production-level performance. We use a semi-supervised approach for data augmentation and presents two different methods for utilizing unlabeled samples. One method relies directly on existing catalogs, while the other uses a generative model. We compare the pros and cons of each approach and present our experimental results.\",\n}\n",
