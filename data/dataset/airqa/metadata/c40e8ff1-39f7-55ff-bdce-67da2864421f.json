Previous studies on DEFI failed to link the document-level event factuality with various sentence-level factuality values in the same document. In this paper, we innovatively propose an event factuality inference task to bridge the sentence-level and the document-level event factuality semantically. Specifically, we present a Sentence-to-Document Inference Network (SDIN) that contains a multi-layer interaction module and a gated aggregation module to integrate the above two tasks, and employ a multi-task learning framework to improve the performance of DEFI. The experimental results on the public English and Chinese DLEF datasets show that our model outperforms the SOTA baselines significantly.\",\n}\n",
