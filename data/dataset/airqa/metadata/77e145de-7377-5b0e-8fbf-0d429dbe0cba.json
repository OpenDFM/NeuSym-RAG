We introduces an interactive unstructured text annotation and knowledge extraction system that synergistically integrates LLMs and ModelOps to alleviate these issues. The system leverages LLMs for enhanced performance in low-resource contexts, employs a ModelOps platform to monitor models throughout their lifecycle, and amalgamates interactive annotation methods with online machine learning and active learning.
