To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a method to incorporate Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which describes semantic representation of a sentence as a directed graph, into a text generation model. Furthermore, two regularizers are designed to guide cross attention weights allocation over AMR graphs. One is the identical regularizer that constrains attention weights of aligned nodes, the other is the entropy regularizer that helps the decoder generate tokens by heavily considering only a few related nodes in the AMR graph.
