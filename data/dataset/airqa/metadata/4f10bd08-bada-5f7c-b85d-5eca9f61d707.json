Furthermore, we compare language-specific encoders against the application of English encoders to translated texts. As the contexts given in the task datasets are extremely short, we also experiment with augmenting these contexts with descriptions generated by a language model. This yields substantial improvements in accuracy. We describe and evaluate additional V-WSD methods which use image generation and text-conditioned image segmentation. Some of our experimental results exceed those of our official submissions on the test set. Our code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/UAlberta-NLP/v-wsd}.\",\n}\n",
