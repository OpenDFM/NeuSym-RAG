We test differentoversampling strategies, a strategy ofadding textual features from predictions obtainedwith related models, and present bothinconclusive and negative results. We achievea robust ranking across languages and subtaskswith our best ranking being nr. 1 for Subtask 3on Spanish.\",\n}\n",
