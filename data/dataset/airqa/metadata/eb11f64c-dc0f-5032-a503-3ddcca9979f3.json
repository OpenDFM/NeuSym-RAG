To address this issue, dominant studies resort to $k$NN-MT with adaptive retrieval ($k$NN-MT-AR), which dynamically estimates $\\lambda$ and skips $k$NN retrieval if $\\lambda$ is less than a fixed threshold. Unfortunately, $k$NN-MT-AR does not yield satisfactory results. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary study to reveal two key limitations of $k$NN-MT-AR: 1) the optimization gap leads to inaccurate estimation of $\\lambda$ for determining $k$NN retrieval skipping, and 2) using a fixed threshold fails to accommodate the dynamic demands for $k$NN retrieval at different timesteps. To mitigate these limitations, we then propose $k$NN-MT with dynamic retrieval ($k$NN-MT-DR) that significantly extends vanilla $k$NN-MT in two aspects. Firstly, we equip $k$NN-MT with a MLP-based classifier for determining whether to skip $k$NN retrieval at each timestep. Particularly, we explore several carefully-designed scalar features to fully exert the potential of the classifier. Secondly, we propose a timestep-aware threshold adjustment method to dynamically generate the threshold, which further improves the efficiency of our model.
