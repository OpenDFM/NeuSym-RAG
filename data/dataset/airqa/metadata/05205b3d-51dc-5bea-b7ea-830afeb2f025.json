From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already in middle layers allow for decoding a semantically correct next token, but giving higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space.

We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in ”input space”, ”concept space”, and ”output space”, respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract ”concept space” lies closer to English than to other input languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases embodied by multilingual language models.",
