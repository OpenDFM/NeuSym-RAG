Our task is to detect writers{'} stances (Favor, Against, or None) towards three selected topics (COVID-19 vaccine, digital transformation, and women empowerment). We present our approach primarily relying on a contrastive loss ensemble strategy. Our proposed approach achieved an F1-score of 0.8438 and ranked first in the stanceEval 2024 task.
