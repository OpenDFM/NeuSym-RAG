Our best-performing approach has been based on BERT large, with 4 classification heads, implementing two different classification approaches (with different activation and loss functions), and two different partitioning of the training data, to handle class imbalance. Classification is performed through majority voting. The proposed approach outperforms the BERT baseline, ranking in the upper half of the competition.\",\n}\n",
