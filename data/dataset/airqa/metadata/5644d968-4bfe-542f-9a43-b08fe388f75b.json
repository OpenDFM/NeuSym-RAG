In contrast to using the SSS model for initialization, our method is more suitable to memory constrained scenario such as on-device deployment. Our method is based on Discrete Speech Units (DSU) extracted from the SSS model. In the first step, our method pretrains two smaller encoder-decoder models on 1) Filterbank-to-DSU (Fbk-to-DSU) and 2) DSU-to-Translation (DSU-to-Trl) data respectively. The DSU thus become the distillation inputs of the smaller models. Subsequently, the encoder from the Fbk-to-DSU model and the decoder from the DSU-to-Trl model are taken to initialise the compact model. Finally, the compact model is finetuned on the paired Fbk-Trl data. In addition to being compact, our method requires no transcripts, making it applicable to low-resource settings. It also avoids speech discretization in inference and is more robust to the DSU tokenization. Evaluation on CoVoST-2 (X-En) shows that our method has consistent improvement over the baseline in three metrics while being compact i.e., only half the SSS model size.\",\n}\n",
