However, FCNNs have been shown to perform inefficient splitting for review features, making the model difficult to clearly differentiate helpful from unhelpful reviews. Furthermore, pairwise objective, which works on review pairs, may not completely capture the MRHP goal to produce the ranking for the entire review list, and possibly induces low generalization during testing. To address these issues, we propose a listwise attention network that clearly captures the MRHP ranking context and a listwise optimization objective that enhances model generalization.
