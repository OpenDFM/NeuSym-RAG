The main contributions of our system include analyzing the performance of different transformer-based pre-trained models and combining these models, as well as providing an efficient method using large amounts of unlabeled data for model adaptive pretraining. We have also explored several other strategies. On the test dataset, our system achieves F1-scores of 83{\\%}, 64{\\%}, and 47{\\%} on subtasks A, B, and C, respectively.\",\n}\n",
