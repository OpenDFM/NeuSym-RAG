We find that the signals exchanged in the tail end of the spectrum, i.e. corresponding to the singular vectors with smallest singular values, are responsible for attention sinking (Xiao et al., 2023), of which we provide an explanation. We find that the negative log-likelihood of pretrained models can be kept low despite suppressing sizeable parts of the embedding spectrum in a layer-dependent way, as long as attention sinking is preserved. Finally, we discover that the representation of tokens that draw attention from many tokens have large projections on the tail end of the spectrum, and likely act as additional attention sinks.\",\n}\n",
