In this pa-per, we present our systems for SemEval-2023Task 6: understanding legal texts (Modi et al., 2023). Specifically, we first develop the Legal-BERT-HSLN model that considers the com-prehensive context information in both intra-and inter-sentence levels to predict rhetoricalroles (subtask A) and then train a Legal-LUKEmodel, which is legal-contextualized and entity-aware, to recognize legal entities (subtask B).Our evaluations demonstrate that our designedmodels are more accurate than baselines, e.g.,with an up to 15.0{\\%} better F1 score in subtaskB. We achieved notable performance in the taskleaderboard, e.g., 0.834 micro F1 score, andranked No.5 out of 27 teams in subtask A.\",\n}\n",
