However, few studies are dedicated to studying the text encoders learned by CLIP. In this paper, we analyze the difference between \\textit{BERT-style} and \\textit{CLIP-style} text encoders from three experiments: (i) general text understanding, (ii) vision-centric text understanding, and (iii) text-to-image generation. Experimental analyses show that although CLIP-style text encoders underperform BERT-style ones for general text understanding tasks, they are equipped with a unique ability, \\textit{i.e.}, \\textit{synesthesia}, for the cross-modal association, which is more similar to the senses of humans.\",\n}\n",
