One of the methods to achieve this is controllable style transfer, which allows for the control of the degree of style transfer. However, an issue encountered with controllable style transfer is the instability of transferred text fluency when the degree of the style transfer changes. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that incorporates additional syntax parsing information during style transfer. By leveraging the syntactic information, our model is guided to generate natural sentences that effectively reflect the desired style while maintaining fluency. Experimental results show that our method achieves robust performance and improved fluency compared to previous controllable style transfer methods.\",\n}\n",
