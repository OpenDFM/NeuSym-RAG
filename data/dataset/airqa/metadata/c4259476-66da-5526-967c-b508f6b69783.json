Due to the sensitive nature of patient electronic health records (EHRs), locally run models are preferred for a variety of reasons including privacy, bias, and cost. However, most open-source locally run models (including medical-specific) are much smaller with limited input context size compared to the more powerful closed-source large language models (LLMs) generally available through web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). In this paper, we propose a framework to harness superior reasoning capabilities and medical knowledge from closed-source online LLMs in a privacy-preserving manner and seamlessly incorporate it into locally run models. Specifically, we leverage a web-based model to distill the vast patient information available in EHRs into a clinically relevant subset without sending sensitive patient health information online and use this distilled knowledge to generate progress notes by a locally run model. Our ablation results indicate that the proposed framework improves the performance of the Mixtral model on progress note generation by 4.6 points on ROUGE (a text-matching based metric) and 7.56 points on MEDCON F1 (a metric that measures the clinical concepts overlap).\",\n}\n",
