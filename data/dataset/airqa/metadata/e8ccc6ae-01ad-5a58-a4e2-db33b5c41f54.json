We also integrate existing cross-lingual search algorithms with event extraction capabilities to provide cross-lingual event-centric search, allowing English-speaking users to search over events automatically extracted from a corpus of non-English documents, using either English natural language queries (e.g. {``}cholera outbreaks in Iran{''}) or structured queries (e.g. find all events of type Disease-Outbreak with agent {``}cholera{''} and location {``}Iran{''}).\",\n}\n",
