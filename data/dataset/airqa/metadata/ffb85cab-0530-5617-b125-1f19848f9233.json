However, higher accuracy often requires more memory consumption and inference latency, which might not necessarily be efficient enough for direct deployment in the real world. Thus, a trade-off between accuracy, memory consumption and processing speed is pursued. In this paper, we will survey recent advancements in the efficiency of ODQA models and conclude core techniques for achieving efficiency. Additionally, we will provide a quantitative analysis of memory cost, query speed, accuracy, and overall performance comparison. Our goal is to keep scholars informed of the latest advancements and open challenges in ODQA efficiency research and contribute to the further development of ODQA efficiency.\",\n}\n",
