Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs{'} susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs{'} belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs{'} correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies.\",\n}\n",
