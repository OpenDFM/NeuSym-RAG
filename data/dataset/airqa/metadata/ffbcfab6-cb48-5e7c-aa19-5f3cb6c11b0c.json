One of the weaknesses of self-training is the semantic drift problem, where noisy pseudo-labels accumulate over iterations and consequently the error rate soars. In order to tackle this challenge, we reshape the role of pseudo-labels and create a hierarchical order of information. In addition, a crucial step in self-training is to use the classifier confidence prediction to select the best candidate pseudo-labels. This step cannot be efficiently done by neural networks, because it is known that their output is poorly calibrated. To overcome this challenge, we propose a hybrid metric to replace the plain confidence measurement. Our metric takes into account the prediction uncertainty via a subsampling technique. We evaluate our model in a set of five standard benchmarks, and show that it significantly outperforms a set of ten diverse baseline models. Furthermore, we show that the improvement achieved by our model is additive to language model pretraining, which is a widely used technique for using unlabeled documents.\",\n}\n",
