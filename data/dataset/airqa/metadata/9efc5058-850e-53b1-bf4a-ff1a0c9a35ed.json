    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with annotating the syntax of ancient Chinese, which is a series of languages in the same development process. The major challenge is to ensure the annotations of languages at different stages are comparable. To this end, we propose a featurebased approach that integrates the deductive feature design from the Chomskyan school and the inductive feature design from traditional philological studies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by annotating a collection of representative sentences that cover various linguistic phenomena that are extensively discussed in the literature. As a result, we establish a corpus of 673 (for now) ancient Chinese sentences paired with syntactic analyses, covering from 700s B.C.E. to 1900s C.E. The corpus can be utilised as a guideline for future large-scale TreeBanking.",
