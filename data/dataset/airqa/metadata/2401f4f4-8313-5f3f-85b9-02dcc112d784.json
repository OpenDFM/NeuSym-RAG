The results of experiments comparing our model to an existing rule-based subjectivity regressor and a state-of-the-art binary classifier reveal that: 1) our model highly correlates with the human subjectivity ratings and outperforms the widely used rule-based {``}pattern{''} subjectivity regressor (De Smedt and Daelemans, 2012); 2) our model performs well as a binary classifier and generalizes to the benchmark subjectivity dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004); 3) in contrast, state-of-the-art classifiers trained on the benchmark dataset show catastrophic performance on our human-labeled data. The results bring to light the issues of the gold standard subjectivity dataset, and the models trained on it, which seem to distinguish between the origin/style of the texts rather than subjectivity as perceived by human English speakers.\",\n}\n",
