We experiment with two end-to-end approaches for our submissions: the Whisper and wav2vec 2.0 models. Our primary system gets a BLEU score of 35.1 on the combined data, whereas our contrastive approach gets 18.5. We also provide a manual analysis of our contrastive approach to identify some pitfalls that may have caused this difference.\",\n}\n",
