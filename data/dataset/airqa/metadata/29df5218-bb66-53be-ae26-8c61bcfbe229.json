In this paper, we explore the importance of conscious experimental design in the language documentation and description setting, particularly the distribution of the unannotated sample pool. We focus on the task of morphological inflection using a Transformer model. We propose context motivated benchmarks: a baseline and skyline. The baseline describes the frequency weighted distribution encountered in natural speech. We simulate this using Wikipedia texts. The skyline defines the more common approach, uniform sampling from a large, balanced corpus (UniMorph, in our case), which often yields mixed results. We note the unrealistic nature of this unannotated pool. When these factors are considered, our results show a clear benefit to targeted sampling.\",\n}\n",
