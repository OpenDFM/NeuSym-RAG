    "abstract": "We present the results of the WASSA 2023 Shared-Task 2: Emotion Classification on code-mixed text messages (Roman Urdu + English), which included two tracks for emotion classification: multi-label and multi-class. The participants were provided with a dataset of code-mixed SMS messages in English and Roman Urdu labeled with 12 emotions for both tracks. A total of 5 teams (19 team members) participated in the shared task. We summarized the methods, resources, and tools used by the participating teams. We also made the data freely available for further improvements to the task.",
