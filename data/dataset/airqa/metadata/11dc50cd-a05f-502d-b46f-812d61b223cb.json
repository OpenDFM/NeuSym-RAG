These agents collaborate on aspect detection, opinion detection, aspect classification, and intensity estimation. We created 8 sentiment intensity agents with distinct character traits to mimic diverse sentiment perceptions and average their outputs. The AI agents received clear instructions and 20 training examples to ensure task understanding. Our results suggest that the MAC model is effective in solving the dimABSA task and offers a transparent and rational approach to understanding the solution process.\",\n}\n",
