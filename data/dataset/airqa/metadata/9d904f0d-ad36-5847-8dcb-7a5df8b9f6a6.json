In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns to predict persona information based on the dialogue history to personalize the dialogue agent without relying on any explicit persona descriptions during inference. Experimental results on the PersonaChat dataset show that the proposed method can improve the consistency of generated responses when conditioning on the predicted profile of the dialogue agent (i.e. {``}self persona{''}), and improve the engagingness of the generated responses when conditioning on the predicted persona of the dialogue partner (i.e. {``}their persona{''}). We also find that a trained persona prediction model can be successfully transferred to other datasets and help generate more relevant responses.\",\n}\n",
