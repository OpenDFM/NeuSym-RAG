As a basis to structure a discussion, we identify the responding relations in the conversation discourse, which link response utterances to their initiations. To figure out who responded to whom, here we explore how the consistency of topic contents and dependency of discourse roles indicate such interactions, whereas most prior work ignore the effects of latent factors underlying word occurrences. We propose a neural model to learn latent topics and discourse in word distributions, and predict pairwise initiation-response links via exploiting topic consistency and discourse dependency. Experimental results on both English and Chinese conversations show that our model significantly outperforms the previous state of the arts.\",\n}\n",
