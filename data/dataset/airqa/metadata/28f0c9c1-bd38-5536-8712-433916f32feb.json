The Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS) task aims at detecting sexism in English text in an accurate and explainable way, thanks to a fine-grained annotation that follows a three-level schema: sexist or not (Task A), category of sexism (Task B) and vector of sexism (Task C) exhibited. We use a multi-task learning approach in which models share representations from all three tasks, allowing for knowledge to be shared across them. Notably, with our approach a single model can solve all three tasks. In addition, motivated by the subjective nature of the task, we incorporate inter-annotator agreement information in our multi-task architecture. Although disaggregated annotations are not available, we artificially estimate them using a 5-classifier ensemble, and show that ensemble agreement can be a good approximation of crowd agreement. Our approach achieves competitive results, ranking 32nd out of 84, 24th out of 69 and 11th out of 63 for Tasks A, B and C respectively. We finally show that low inter-annotator agreement levels are associated with more challenging examples for models, making agreement information use ful for this kind of task.\",\n}\n",
