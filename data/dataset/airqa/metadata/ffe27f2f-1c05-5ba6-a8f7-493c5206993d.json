However, a large reduction in the number of attackable parameters in PET will cause the user{'}s fine-tuning to greatly affect the effectiveness of backdoor attacks, resulting in backdoor forgetting. We find that the backdoor injection process can be regarded as multi-task learning, which has a convergence imbalance problem between the training of clean and poisoned data.

One controls the gradient magnitude distribution cross layers within one task and the other prevents the conflict of gradient directions between tasks.
