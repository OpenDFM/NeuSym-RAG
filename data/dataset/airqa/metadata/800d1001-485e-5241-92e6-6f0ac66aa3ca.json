Our system comprises evaluating various baseline models using OpenAI GPT-3 and designing diverse prompts to prompt the OpenAI models for teacher response generation. After the challenge, our system achieved second place by employing a few-shot prompt-based approach with the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model. The results highlight the few-shot learning capabilities of large-language models, particularly OpenAI{'}s GPT-3, in the role of AI teachers.\",\n}\n",
