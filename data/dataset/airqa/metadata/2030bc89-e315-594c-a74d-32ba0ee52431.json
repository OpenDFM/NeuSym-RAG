We present a careful analysis of experts{'} evaluation, which focuses on new aspects such as the comprehensiveness of the answer. Next, we examine automatic text generation metrics, finding that no existing metrics are predictive of human preference judgments. However, some metrics correlate with fine-grained aspects of answers (e.g., coherence). We encourage future work to move away from a single {``}overall score{''} of the answer and adopt a multi-faceted evaluation, targeting aspects such as factuality and completeness.
