In this study, we view partial code as implementation hints and fine-tune CodeLLMs to jointly rewrite and complete partial code into functional full programs. We explore two strategies: one-pass generation and multi-pass iterative refinement. We construct new training and testing datasets using semantic-altering code transformations and iterative self-generations.We conduct comprehensive experiments over three representative open-sourced CodeLLMs {--} InCoder, CodeGen, and StarCoder.Results show that CodeLLMs fine-tuned using our approach achieve superior pass rates compared to the previous baselines across existing and newly-created benchmarks, effectively handle both potentially buggy and clean code, and largely preserve the integrity of the original partial implementations.
