We introduce a taxonomy that elucidates the connection between several problems in lexical semantics, including monolingual and cross-lingual variants. Our theoretical framework is based on the hypothesis of the equivalence of concept and meaning distinctions. Using algorithmic problem reductions, we demonstrate that all problems in the taxonomy can be reduced to word sense disambiguation (WSD), and that WSD itself can be reduced to some problems, making them theoretically equivalent. In addition, we carry out experiments that strongly support the soundness of the concept-meaning hypothesis, and the correctness of our reductions.\",\n}\n",
