We devised strategies to improve the existing model to fit the task better, e.g. with different special mod- els and a post-processor tailored to different inherent challenges of the task. Furthermore, we explored the possibility of expanding the original training data by using strategies from Heuristic Labeling and Semi-Supervised Learn- ing. With those adjustments, we were able to improve the baseline by 9.8 percentage points to a BLEU-4 score of 48.0{\\%}.\",\n}\n",
