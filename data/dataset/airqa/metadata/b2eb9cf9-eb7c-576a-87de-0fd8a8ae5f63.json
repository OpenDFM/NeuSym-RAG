To this end, we construct a large-scale Bilingual Multi-category dataset of Euphemisms named BME, which covers a total of 12 categories for two languages, English and Chinese. Then, we first propose a unified generative model to Jointly conduct the tasks of bilingual Euphemism Detection and Identification named JointEDI.
