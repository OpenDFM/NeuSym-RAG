However, existing datasets for evaluating causal reasoning in LLMs are limited by narrow domain coverage and a focus on cause-to-effect reasoning through textual problems, which does not comprehensively assess whether LLMs truly grasp causal relationships or merely guess correct answers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel benchmark that spans textual, mathematical, and coding problem domains. Each problem is crafted to probe causal understanding from four perspectives: cause-to-effect, effect-to-cause, cause-to-effect with intervention, and effect-to-cause with intervention. This multi-dimensional evaluation method ensures that LLMs must exhibit a genuine understanding of causal structures by correctly answering questions across all four dimensions, mitigating the possibility of correct responses by chance. Furthermore, our benchmark explores the relationship between an LLM{'}s causal reasoning performance and its tendency to produce hallucinations. We present evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs using our benchmark, providing valuable insights into their current causal reasoning capabilities across diverse domains.
