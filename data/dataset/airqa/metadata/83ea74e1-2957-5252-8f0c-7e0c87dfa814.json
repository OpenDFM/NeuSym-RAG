This paper presents a simple, fast, and effective Neural web Scraper (NeuScraper) to help extract primary and clean text contents from webpages. Experimental results show that NeuScraper surpasses the baseline scrapers by achieving more than a 20{\\%} improvement, demonstrating its potential in extracting higher-quality data to facilitate the language model pretraining.
