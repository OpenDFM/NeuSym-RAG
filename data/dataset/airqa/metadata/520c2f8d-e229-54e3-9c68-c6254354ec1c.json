In the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters that can be represented by computer text encoding systems, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present $\\textbf{Visual-C}$$^3$, a human-annotated $\\textbf{Visual}$ $\\textbf{C}$hinese $\\textbf{C}$haracter $\\textbf{C}$hecking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet challenging. As the first study focusing on Chinese faked characters, the dataset and the baseline methods are publicly available at https://github.com/THUKElab/Visual-C3.\",\n}\n",
