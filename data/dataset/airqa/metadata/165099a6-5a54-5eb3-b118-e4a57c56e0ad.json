We evaluate these models against two state of the art DWSI models, using a time-stamped labelled dataset from the biomedical domain. We demonstrate that the two proposed models perform better than the state of the art. In particular, the HDP-based model drastically outperforms all the other models, including the dynamic neural model.\",\n}\n",
