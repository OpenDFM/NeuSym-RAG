When compared to in-domain (ID) samples, the models have been known to usually perform poorer on OOD samples, although this observation is not consistent. Another thread of research has focused on OOD detection, albeit mostly using supervised approaches. In this work, we first consolidate and present a systematic analysis of multiple definitions of OOD and OODist as discussed in prior literature. Then, we analyze the performance of a model under ID and OOD/OODist settings in a principled way. Finally, we seek to identify an unsupervised method for reliably identifying OOD/OODist samples without using a trained model. The results of our extensive evaluation using 12 datasets from 4 different tasks suggest the promising potential of unsupervised metrics in this task.\",\n}\n",
