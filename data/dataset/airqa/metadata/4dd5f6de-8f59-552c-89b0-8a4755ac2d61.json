A main challenge is the expensive annotation costs and the annotation bias. In this work, we study video sentence localization in a zero-shot setting, which learns with only video data without any annotation. Existing zero-shot pipelines usually generate event proposals and then generate a pseudo query for each event proposal. However, their event proposals are obtained via visual feature clustering, which is query-independent and inaccurate; and the pseudo-queries are short or less interpretable. Moreover, existing approaches ignores the risk of pseudo-label noise when leveraging them in training. To address the above problems, we propose a Structure-based Pseudo Label generation (SPL), which first generate free-form interpretable pseudo queries before constructing query-dependent event proposals by modeling the event temporal structure. To mitigate the effect of pseudo-label noise, we propose a noise-resistant iterative method that repeatedly re-weight the training sample based on noise estimation to train a grounding model and correct pseudo labels. Experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and Charades-STA datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach. Code can be found at \\url{https://github.com/minghangz/SPL}.\",\n}\n",
