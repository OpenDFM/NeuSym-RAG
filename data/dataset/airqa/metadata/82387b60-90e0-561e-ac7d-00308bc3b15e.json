We exhaustively experiment with three popular VEs on six downstream V+L tasks and analyze the attention and VE-dropout patterns. Our analyses suggest that diverse VEs complement each other, resulting in improved downstream V+L task performance, where the improvements are not due to simple ensemble effects (i.e. the performance does not always improve when increasing the number of encoders). We demonstrate that future VEs, which are not \\textit{repurposed}, but explicitly \\textit{designed} for V+L tasks, have the potential of improving performance on the target V+L tasks.\",\n}\n",
