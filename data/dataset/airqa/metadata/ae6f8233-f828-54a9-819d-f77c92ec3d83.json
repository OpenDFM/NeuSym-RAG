The baseline model is the one that is trained on the whole pseudo-parallel corpus. Our Few-shot QE model transfer learned from the English-Marathi QE model and fine-tuned on only 500 Hindi-Bengali training instances, shows an improvement of up to 0.6 BLEU points for Hindi-Bengali language pair, compared to the baseline model.

Our Hindi-Bengali QE is trained on only 500 instances of training that is 1/40th of the normal requirement and achieves comparable performance.
