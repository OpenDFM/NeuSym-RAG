Brain encoding involves the mapping of linguistic stimuli to brain activity, while brain decoding is the process of reconstructing linguistic stimuli from observed brain activities. CL models that excel at capturing and manipulating linguistic features are crucial for mapping linguistic stimuli to brain activities and vice versa. Brain encoding and decoding have vast applications, from enhancing human-computer interaction to developing assistive technologies for individuals with communication impairments. This tutorial will focus on elucidating how computational linguistics can facilitate brain encoding and decoding. We will delve into the principles and practices of using computational linguistics methods for brain encoding and decoding. We will also discuss the challenges and future directions of brain encoding and decoding.
