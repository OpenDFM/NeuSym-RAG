LePaRD contains millions of examples of U.S. federal judges citing precedent in context. The dataset aims to facilitate work on legal passage retrieval, a challenging practice-oriented legal retrieval and reasoning task. Legal passage retrieval seeks to predict relevant passages from precedential court decisions given the context of a legal argument. We extensively evaluate various approaches on LePaRD, and find that classification-based retrieval appears to work best. Our best models only achieve a recall of 59{\\%} when trained on data corresponding to the 10,000 most-cited passages, underscoring the difficulty of legal passage retrieval. By publishing LePaRD, we provide a large-scale and high quality resource to foster further research on legal passage retrieval. We hope that research on this practice-oriented NLP task will help expand access to justice by reducing the burden associated with legal research via computational assistance.
