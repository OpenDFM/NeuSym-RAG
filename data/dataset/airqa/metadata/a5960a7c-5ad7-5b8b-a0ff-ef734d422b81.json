In this competition the task is to find artificially generated token-level text fragments in documents of a scientific domain. Our work focuses on the use of a multi-task learning architecture with two heads. The application of this approach is justified by the specificity of the task, where class spans are continuous over several hundred characters. We considered different encoder variations to obtain a state vector for each token in the sequence, as well as a variation in splitting fragments into tokens to further feed into the input of a transform-based encoder. This approach allows us to achieve a 9{\\%} quality improvement relative to the baseline solution score on the development set (from 0.86 to 0.95) using the average macro $F_{1}$-score, as well as a score of 0.96 on a closed test part of the dataset from the competition.\",\n}\n",
