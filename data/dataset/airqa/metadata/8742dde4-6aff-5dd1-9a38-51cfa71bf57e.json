The proposal of this work is a symptom tracker, which is a neural network that processes texts and captures symptoms in messages exchanged between citizens of the state and the Plant{\\~a}o Coronavirus nurse/doctor, i.e., clinical conversations. The model has the ability to recognize new patterns and has identified a high incidence of altered psychological behaviors, including anguish, anxiety, and sadness, among users who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. As a result, the tool has emphasized the importance of expanding coverage through community mental health services in the state.\",\n}\n",
