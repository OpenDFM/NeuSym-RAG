    "abstract": "Thus far, the research community has focused on a simplified computational modeling of semantic change between two time periods. This simplified view has served as a foundational block but is not a complete solution to the complex modeling of semantic change. Acknowledging the power of recent language models, we believe that now is the right time to extend the current modeling to multiple time periods and diachronic word sense induction. In this position paper, we outline several extensions of the current modeling and discuss issues related to the extensions.",
