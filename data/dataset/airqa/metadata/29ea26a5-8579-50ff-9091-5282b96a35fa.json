Our approach uses pair-level supervised contrastive learning to classify pairs of sentences. We trained EvidenceSCL on two datasets created from NLI4CT and additional data from other NLI datasets. We show that our approach can address both goals of NLI4CT, and although it reached an intermediate position, there is room for improvement in the technique.\",\n}\n",
