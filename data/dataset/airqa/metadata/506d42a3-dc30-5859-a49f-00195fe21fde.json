    "abstract": "The recently introduced FNet model (LeeThorp et al., 2022) computes a two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequencelength-by-hidden-dimension-sized representation of its input. Because it is equally efficient to compute the DFT of any reshaping of this input matrix, we investigate the extent to which increasing the frequency resolution in one dimension (at the expense of the other) affects task performance. We consider the LRA tasks (Tay et al., 2021) considered by LeeThorpe et al., as well as the more practical setting of using FNet as the encoder in a machine translation (MT) model. We find that frequency resolution has a marked task-dependent effect on performance, allowing us to largely outperform standard FNet on our tasks, and suggesting that resolution should be carefully tuned before deploying FNet.",
