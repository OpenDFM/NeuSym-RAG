Specifically, CFLUE provides datasets tailored for both knowledge assessment and application assessment. In knowledge assessment, it consists of 38K+ multiple-choice questions with associated solution explanations. These questions serve dual purposes: answer prediction and question reasoning. In application assessment, CFLUE features 16K+ test instances across distinct groups of NLP tasks such as text classification, machine translation, relation extraction, reading comprehension, and text generation. Upon CFLUE, we conduct a thorough evaluation of representative LLMs. The results reveal that only Qwen-72B, GPT-4, and GPT-4-turbo achieve an accuracy exceeding 60{\\%} in answer prediction for knowledge assessment, suggesting that there is still substantial room for improvement in current LLMs. In application assessment, while GPT-4 and GPT-4-turbo rank as the top two performers on average, their significant advantage over open-source LLMs is noticeably diminished, given that Qwen-72B achieves the best performance in 2 out of 5 tasks. The datasets and scripts associated with CFLUE are openly accessible at \\url{https://github.com/aliyun/cflue}.\",\n}\n",
