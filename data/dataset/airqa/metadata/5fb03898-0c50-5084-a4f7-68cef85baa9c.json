Despite the recent advances in VQA, existing methods mainly adopt a discriminative formulation that predicts answers within a pre-defined label set, leading to easy overfitting on low-resource domains (e.g., medicine) and poor generalization under domain shift to another dataset. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel generative model enhanced by multimodal prompt retrieval (MPR) that integrates retrieved prompts and multimodal features to generate answers in free text. Our generative model enables rapid zero-shot dataset adaptation to unseen data distributions and open-set answer labels across datasets. Our experiments on medical VQA tasks show that MPR outperforms its non-retrieval counterpart by up to 30{\\%} accuracy points in a few-shot domain adaptation setting.\",\n}\n",
