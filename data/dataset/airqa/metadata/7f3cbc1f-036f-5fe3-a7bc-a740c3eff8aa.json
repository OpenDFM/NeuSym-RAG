This paper describes the approaches of the SemEval-2023 Task 10 competition for Explainable Online Sexism Detection (EDOS). The task has been divided into 3 subtasks, introducing different classes of sexist comments. We have approached these tasks using the bert-cased and uncased models which are trained on the annotated dataset that has been provided in the competition. Task A provided the best F1 score of 80{\\%} on the test set, and tasks B and C provided 58{\\%} and 40{\\%} respectively.\",\n}\n",
