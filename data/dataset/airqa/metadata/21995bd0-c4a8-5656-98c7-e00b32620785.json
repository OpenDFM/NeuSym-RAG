Motivated by this observation, we introduce a novel framework, called BREAK (Beam search and RE-rAnKing), that achieves outstanding performance on DST. BREAK performs DST in two stages: (i) generating k-best dialogue state candidates with beam search and (ii) re-ranking the candidates to select the correct dialogue state. This simple yet powerful framework shows state-of-the-art performance on all versions of MultiWOZ and M2M datasets. Most notably, we push the joint goal accuracy to 80-90{\\%} on MultiWOZ 2.1-2.4, which is an improvement of 23.6{\\%}, 26.3{\\%}, 21.7{\\%}, and 10.8{\\%} over the previous best-performing models, respectively.
