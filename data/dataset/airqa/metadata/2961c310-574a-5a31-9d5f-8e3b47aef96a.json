Existing approaches at the intersection of Continual Learning and Visual Question Answering (VQA) do not study how the multimodal nature of the input affects the learning dynamics of a model. In this paper, we demonstrate that each modality evolves at different rates across a continuum of tasks and that this behavior occurs in established encoder-only models as well as modern recipes for developing Vision {\\&} Language (VL) models. Motivated by this observation, we propose a modality-aware feature distillation (MAFED) approach which outperforms existing baselines across models of varying scale in three multimodal continual learning settings. Furthermore, we provide ablations showcasing that modality-aware distillation complements experience replay. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of addressing modality-specific dynamics to prevent forgetting in multimodal continual learning.\",\n}\n",
