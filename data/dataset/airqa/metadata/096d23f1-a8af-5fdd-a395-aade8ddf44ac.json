We will introduce the fundamentals of text watermarking, discuss the main challenges in identifying AI-generated text, and delve into the current watermarking methods, assessing their strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, we will explore other possible applications of text watermarking and discuss future directions for this field. Each section will be supplemented with examples and key takeaways.\",\n}\n",
