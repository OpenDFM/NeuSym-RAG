As a fast-moving and dynamic area of study with high interest from students, natural language processing is an ideal subject for innovative teaching methodologies to improve student outcomes. We detail our experience with teaching natural language processing through partnership with students and provide detailed descriptions of methodologies that can be used by others in their teaching, including considerations of diverse student populations.\",\n}\n",
