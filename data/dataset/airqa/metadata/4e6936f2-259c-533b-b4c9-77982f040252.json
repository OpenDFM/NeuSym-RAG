To address these problems, we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead adversarial training with only clean data. Our procedure, distribution shift risk minimization (DSRM), estimates the adversarial loss by perturbing the input data{'}s probability distribution rather than their embeddings. This formulation results in a robust model that minimizes the expected global loss under adversarial attacks. Our approach requires zero adversarial samples for training and reduces time consumption by up to 70{\\%} compared to current best-performing adversarial training methods. Experiments demonstrate that DSRM considerably improves BERT{'}s resistance to textual adversarial attacks and achieves state-of-the-art robust accuracy on various benchmarks.\",\n}\n",
