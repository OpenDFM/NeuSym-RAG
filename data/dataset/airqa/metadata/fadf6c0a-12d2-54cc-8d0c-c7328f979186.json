To address this challenge and protect consumers, initiatives have emerged to substantiate green claims. With the proliferation of environmental and scientific assertions, a critical need arises for automated methods to detect and validate these claims at scale. In this paper, we introduce EnClaim, a transformer network architecture augmented with stylistic features for automatically detecting claims from open web documents or social media posts. The proposed model considers various linguistic stylistic features in conjunction with language models to predict whether a given statement constitutes a claim. We have rigorously evaluated the model using multiple open datasets. Our initial findings indicate that incorporating stylistic vectors alongside the BERT-based language model enhances the overall effectiveness of environmental claim detection.\",\n}\n",
