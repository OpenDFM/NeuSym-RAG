To overcome this critical gap, we employ a recently introduced approach that couples LLM generations for scale with culturally situated validations for reliability, and build SeeGULL Multilingual, a global-scale multilingual dataset of social stereotypes, containing over 25K stereotypes, spanning 23 pairs of languages and regions they are common in, with human annotations, and demonstrate its utility in identifying gaps in model evaluations.\",\n}\n",
