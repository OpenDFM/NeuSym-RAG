We analyze gender bias in two Language and Vision datasets. Consistent with prior work, we find that both datasets underrepresent women, which promotes their invisibilization. Moreover, we hypothesize and find that a bias affects human naming choices for people playing sports: speakers produce names indicating the sport (e.g. {``}tennis player{''} or {``}surfer{''}) more often when it is a man or a boy participating in the sport than when it is a woman or a girl, with an average of 46{\\%} vs. 35{\\%} of sports-related names for each gender. A computational model trained on these naming data reproduces thebias. We argue that both the data and the model result in representational harm against women.\",\n}\n",
