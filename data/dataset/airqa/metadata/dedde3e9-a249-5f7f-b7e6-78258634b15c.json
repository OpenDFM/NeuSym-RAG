The train set is translated using Facebook{'}s 1.2B parameter m2m{\\_}100 model. We thoroughly analyze the Croatian train set and compare its quality with the existing machine-translated German set. The comparison is based on 2000 manually scored sentences per language using a variant of the Direct Assessment (DA) score commonly used at the Conference on Machine Translation (WMT). Our findings reveal that a less-resourced language like Croatian is still lacking in translation quality of longer sentences compared to German. However, both sets have a substantial amount of poor quality translations, which should be considered in translation-based training or evaluation setups.\",\n}\n",
