Our study introduces two key designs. First, we propose the concept of retrieval augmented pretraining, which involves refining the language model pretraining to align it more closely with the downstream task of DG. Second, we explore the integration of knowledge graphs and language models to further enhance the performance of DG. Our study unveils promising directions for further development in DG by showcasing the efficacy of knowledge augmentation and task-specific pretraining. These findings demonstrate the potential for leveraging both strategies to enhance the quality and performance of DG systems.\",\n}\n",
