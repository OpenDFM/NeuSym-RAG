Unfortunately, this translates into an improved memorization capacity, raising data privacy concerns. Specifically, it has been shown that models can output personal identifiable information (PII) contained in their training data. However, reported PII extraction performance varies widely, and there is no consensus on the optimal methodology to evaluate this risk, resulting in underestimating realistic adversaries. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that it is possible to improve the extractability of PII by over ten-fold by grounding the prefix of the manually constructed extraction prompt with in-domain data. This approach achieves phone number extraction rates of 0.92{\\%}, 3.9{\\%}, and 6.86{\\%} with 1, 128, and 2308 queries, respectively, i.e., the phone number of 1 person in 15 is extractable.\",\n}\n",
