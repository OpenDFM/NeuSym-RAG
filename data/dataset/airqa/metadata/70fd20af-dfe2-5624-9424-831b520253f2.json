Massively multilingual VL encoder models (mVLMs) hold promise for other languages: after fine-tuning on only English task data, they can perform the task in other languages in what is termed zero-shot cross-lingual transfer (ZS-XLT). Still, ZS-XLT sees a large performance gap to English, especially for low-resource languages. In this work, we reduce this gap with a fine-tuning strategy known as \\textit{Scheduled Unfreezing} (SUF): instead of updating all parameters from the start, we begin with the top layer(s) of the vision-language encoder and gradually unfreeze (i.e., update) its layers top to bottom. SUF forces reliance on encoder{'}s representations from higher layers: the fact that in multilingual models these representations encode higher-level semantics rather than low-level language-specific idiosyncrasies, we hypothesize, should render SUF beneficial for ZS-XLT. Experiments with two mVLMs (UC2 {\\&} CCLM) on three downstream tasks (xGQA, XVNLI, xFlickrCo) show that SUF brings consistent gains in ZS-XLT, especially for visual Q{\\&}A (xGQA) by up to 10 points.\",\n}\n",
