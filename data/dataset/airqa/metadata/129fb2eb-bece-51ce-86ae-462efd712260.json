Despite the effectiveness, existing works require expensive labeling and suffer severe degradation when deployed to an unseen domain. In this paper, we investigate a novel task Cross-domain Query-based Visual Segmentation (CQVS), aiming to adapt the segmentation model from a labeled domain to a new unlabeled domain. The challenges of CQVS stem from three domain discrepancies: (1) multi-modal content shift, (2) uni-modal feature gap and (3) cross-modal relation bias. Existing domain adaptation methods fail to address them comprehensively and precisely (e.g. at pixel level), thus being suboptimal for CQVS. To overcome this limitation, we propose Semantic-conditioned Dual Adaptation (SDA), a novel framework to achieve precise feature- and relation-invariant across domains via a universal semantic structure. The SDA consists of two key components: Content-aware Semantic Modeling (CSM) and Dual Adaptive Branches (DAB). First, CSM introduces a common semantic space across domains to provide uniform guidance. Then, DAB seamlessly leverages this semantic information to develop a contrastive feature branch for category-wise pixel alignment, and design a reciprocal relation branch for relation enhancement via two complementary masks. Extensive experiments on three video benchmarks and three image benchmarks evidence the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-arts.\",\n}\n",
