However, existing text augmentation methods tend to focus on few-shot scenarios and usually perform poorly on large public datasets. Our research indicates that existing augmentation methods often generate instances with shifted feature spaces, which leads to a drop in performance on the augmented data (for example, EDA generally loses approximately 2{\\%} in aspect-based sentiment classification). To address this problem, we propose a hybrid instance-filtering framework (BoostAug) based on pre-trained language models that can maintain a similar feature space with natural datasets. BoostAug is transferable to existing text augmentation methods (such as synonym substitution and back translation) and significantly improves the augmentation performance by 2-3{\\%} in classification accuracy. Our experimental results on three classification tasks and nine public datasets show that BoostAug addresses the performance drop problem and outperforms state-of-the-art text augmentation methods. Additionally, we release the code to help improve existing augmentation methods on large datasets.\",\n}\n",
