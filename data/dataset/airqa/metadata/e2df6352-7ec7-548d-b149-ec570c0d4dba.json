Our study addresses this gap by introducing a new dataset, named $\\textsc{MentalManip}$, which consists of 4,000 annotated fictional dialogues. This dataset enables a comprehensive analysis of mental manipulation, pinpointing both the techniques utilized for manipulation and the vulnerabilities targeted in victims. Our research further explores the effectiveness of leading-edge models in recognizing manipulative dialogue and its components through a series of experiments with various configurations. The results demonstrate that these models inadequately identify and categorize manipulative content. Attempts to improve their performance by fine-tuning with existing datasets on mental health and toxicity have not overcome these limitations. We anticipate that $\\textsc{MentalManip}$ will stimulate further research, leading to progress in both understanding and mitigating the impact of mental manipulation in conversations.\",\n}\n",
