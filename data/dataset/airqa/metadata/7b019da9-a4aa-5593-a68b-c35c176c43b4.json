In this work, we leverage LLaVA, a Visual-Language Model (VLM), composed of a vision-encoder, a vision-language connector or adapter, and a large language model able to process text and visual embeddings. We achieve our best result by enriching the input prompt of LLaVA with the text output of a simpler report generation model. With this enriched-prompt technique, we improve our results in 4 of 5 metrics (BLEU-4, Rouge-L, BertScore and F1-RadGraph,), only doing in-context learning. Moreover, we provide details about different architecture settings, fine-tuning strategies, and dataset configurations.\",\n}\n",
