In this work, we introduce VerbCLIP, a verb-centric vision-language model which learns meanings of verbs based on a compositional approach to statistical machine learning. Our methods significantly outperform CLIP in zero-shot performance on the VALSE, VL-Checklist, and SVO-Probes datasets, with improvements of +2.38{\\%}, +3.14{\\%}, and +1.47{\\%}, without fine-tuning. Fine-tuning resulted in further improvements, with gains of +2.85{\\%} and +9.2{\\%} on the VALSE and VL-Checklist datasets.\",\n}\n",
