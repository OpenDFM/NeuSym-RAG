In this paper, we propose a feature-based method for identifying pre-requisite dependencies between academic videos. Our approach involves using a transcript engine with a language model to transcribe domain-specific terms and then extracting novel similarity-based features to determine pre-requisite dependencies between video transcripts. This approach succeeds due to the development of a novel corpus of K-12 academic text, which was created using a proposed feature-based document parser. We evaluate our method on hand-annotated datasets for transcript extraction, video pre-requisites determination, and textbook parsing, which we have released. Our method for pre-requisite edge determination shows significant improvement (+4.7{\\%}-10.24{\\%} F1-score) compared to existing methods.\",\n}\n",
