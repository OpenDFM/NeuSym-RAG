Specifically, we propose metrics to assess the range, calibration, and consistency of the generated text{'}s attribute intensity in response to varying control values, as well as its relevance to the intended context. To quantify the attribute intensity and context relevance, we leverage an Elo rating system and GPT4, respectively, both renowned for their robust alignment with human judgment. We look into two viable training-free methods for achieving smooth control of LLMs: (1) Prompting with semantic shifters, and (2) Modifying internal model representations. The evaluations of these two methods are conducted on 5 different attributes with various models.\",\n}\n",
