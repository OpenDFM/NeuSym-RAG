In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Variational Gated Recurrent Unit (PVGRU). The key novelty of PVGRU is a recurrent summarizing variable thataggregates the accumulated distribution variations of subsequences. We train PVGRU without relying on posterior knowledge, thus avoiding the training-inference inconsistency problem. PVGRU can perceive subtle semantic variability through summarizing variables that are optimized by two objectives we employ for training: distribution consistency and reconstruction. In addition, we build a Pseudo-Variational Hierarchical Dialogue(PVHD) model based on PVGRU. Experimental results demonstrate that PVGRU can broadly improve the diversity andrelevance of responses on two benchmark datasets.\",\n}\n",
