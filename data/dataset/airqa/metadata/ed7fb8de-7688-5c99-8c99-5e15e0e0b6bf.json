Paper data stored in our database is enriched with multi-aspect summaries, extracted named entities, a field of study label, and text embeddings by our data processing pipeline. These metadata are used in our web-based user interface to enable researchers to quickly find papers relevant to their interests, and grasp an overview of papers without reading full-text of papers. To make GenGO to be available online as long as possible, we design GenGO to be simple and efficient to reduce maintenance and financial costs. In addition, the modularity of our data processing pipeline lets developers easily extend it to add new features.
