Recent efforts have released systems that achieve promising performance as measured by widely used summarization metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE. However, the research area of radiology report summarization currently faces two important limitations. First, most of the results are reported on private datasets. This limitation prevents the ability to reproduce results and fairly compare different systems and solutions. Secondly, to the best of our knowledge, most research is carried out on chest X-rays. To palliate these two limitations, we propose a radiology report summarization (RadSum) challenge on i) a new dataset of eleven different modalities and anatomies pairs based on the MIMIC-III database ii) a multimodal report summarization dataset based on MIMIC-CXR enhanced with a brand-new test-set from Stanford Hospital. In total, we received 112 submissions across 11 teams.\",\n}\n",
