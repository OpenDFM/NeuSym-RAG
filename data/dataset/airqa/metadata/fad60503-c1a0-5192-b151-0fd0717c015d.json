For the unseen languages, we ranked third on the leaderboard and achieved a Pearson{'}s r score of 0.485. We used a single multilingual model for all languages, as discussed in this paper. We provide a detailed description of our pipeline along with multiple ablation experiments to further analyse each component of the pipeline. We demonstrate how translation-based augmentation, domain-specific features, and domain-adapted pre-trained models improve the understanding of intimacy in tweets.
