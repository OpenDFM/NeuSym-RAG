Recent work introduces the idea of grammatical error detection (GED) to improve the GEC task performance. In contrast, these explicit multi-stage works propagate and amplify the problem of misclassification of the GED module. To introduce more convincing error type information, we propose an end-to-end framework in this paper, which Leverages Error Type (LET) information in the generation process. First, the input text is fed into a classification module to obtain the error type corresponding to each token. Then, we introduce the category information into the decoder{'}s input and cross-attention module in two ways, respectively. Experiments on various datasets show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods by a clear margin.\",\n}\n",
