Simultaneously, LLMs in practice often fail to correctly or confidently predict the last digit of an $n$-digit by $m$-digit multiplication, a task equivalent to 1-digit by 1-digit multiplication which can be easily learned or memorized. We show that the latter task can be solved more robustly when the LLM is conditioned on all of the correct higher-order digits, which on average increases the confidence of the correct last digit on 5-digit by 5-digit multiplication tasks using Llama 2-13B by over 230{\\%} (0.13â0.43) and Mistral-7B by 150{\\%} (0.22â0.55).\",\n}\n",
