After that, we conduct a joint feature matrix to predict the token type and thus restore the incomplete utterance. The well-designed network and simple architecture make our method significantly superior to existing methods in terms of quality and inference speedOur code is available at \\url{https://github.com/IMU-MachineLearningSXD/MIUR}.\",\n}\n",
