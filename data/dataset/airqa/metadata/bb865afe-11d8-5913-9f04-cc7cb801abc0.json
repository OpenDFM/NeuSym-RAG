We aggregate embeddings of each researcher{'}s multiple publications into a single vector and apply it to research field classification and similar researcher search tasks. We experimented with multiple language models and embedding aggregation methods to compare their performance.From the model perspective, we confirmed the effectiveness of using sentence embedding models and a simple averaging approach.\",\n}\n",
