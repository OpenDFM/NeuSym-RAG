PEFT approaches can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, which enables us to fine-tune larger dialogue generation models. However, the reduction in parameter quantity can diminish a PLM{'}s expressive capacity and affect the PLM{'}s learning from certain specific examples like knowledge-related conversations. Previous works have demonstrated that injecting external knowledge into dialogue generation models can improve the model{'}s performance in knowledge-related conversations. Nonetheless, these methods are designed for the scenario where most parameters of the entire framework are trainable. In this paper, we propose PEK, a parameter-efficient framework for knowledge-enhanced dialogue generation. It enables PLMs to leverage external knowledge documents and knowledge graphs to enhance its generation capabilities with an acceptable number of trainable parameters.
