Thus, we aim to develop a computational metaphor processing online system, termed MetaPro Online, that allows users without a coding background, e.g., language learners and linguists, to easily query metaphoricity labels, metaphor paraphrases, and concept mappings for non-domain-specific text. The outputs of MetaPro can be directly used by language learners and natural language processing downstream tasks because MetaPro is an end-to-end system.\",\n}\n",
