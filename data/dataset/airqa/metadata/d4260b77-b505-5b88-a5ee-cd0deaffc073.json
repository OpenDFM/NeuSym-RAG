Our dataset, which includes a range of scientific abstracts, enables us to address the diverse information needs of our audience. This focus ensures that our summaries are accessible to both general and younger lay audience. Additionally, we employ specialized tokens and augmentation techniques to optimize the model{'}s performance. Our methodology proved effective, earning us the 7th rank on the final leaderboard out of 57 participants.\",\n}\n",
