A new multilingual textual intimacy dataset named MINT was used. It contains tweets in 10 languages, including English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese in both training and test datasets, and Dutch, Korean, Hindi, and Arabic in test data only. In the first experiment, linear regression models combine with the features and word embedding, and XLM-T deep learning model were compared. In the second experiment, cross-lingual learning between languanges was tested. In the third experiments, data was clustered using K-means. The results indicate that XLM-T pre-trained embedding might be a good choice for an unsupervised learning algorithm for intimacy detection.\",\n}\n",
