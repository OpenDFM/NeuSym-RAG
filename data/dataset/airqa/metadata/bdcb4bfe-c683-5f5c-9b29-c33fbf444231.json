The system response performance is significantly affected by the quality of the belief state and action state. We first explore what dialog context representation is beneficial to improving the quality of the belief state and action state, which further enhances the generated response quality. To tackle our exploration, we propose Mars, an end-to-end task-oriented dialog system with two contrastive learning strategies to model the relationship between dialog context and belief/action state representations. Empirical results show dialog context representations, which are more different from semantic state representations, are more conducive to multi-turn task-oriented dialog. Moreover, our proposed Mars achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MultiWOZ 2.0, CamRest676, and CrossWOZ.\",\n}\n",
