In this work, we devise two strategies for mining hard negatives, including (1) crisscrossing a narrative and its contrastive variants; and (2) event-level replacement. To obtain contrastive variants, we utilize the Brownian Bridge process to guarantee the quality of generated contrastive narratives. We evaluate our model on several tasks. The result proves the effectiveness of our method, and shows that our method is applicable to many applications.\",\n}\n",
