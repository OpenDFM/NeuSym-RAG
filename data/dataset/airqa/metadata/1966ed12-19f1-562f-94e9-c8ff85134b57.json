First, we contribute a dataset for studying this problem: SIGHT is a large dataset of 288 math lecture transcripts and 15,784 comments collected from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology OpenCourseWare (MIT OCW) YouTube channel.

These techniques uncover useful student feedback from thousands of comments, costing around {\\$}0.002 per comment.
