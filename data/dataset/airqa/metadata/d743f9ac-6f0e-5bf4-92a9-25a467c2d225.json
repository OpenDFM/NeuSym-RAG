Puzzles are sourced from the {``}5 Minute Mystery{''} platform and include a multiple-choice question for evaluation. Only 47{\\%} of humans solve a puzzle successfully on average, while the best human solvers achieve over 80{\\%} success rate. We show that GPT-3 models barely outperform random on this benchmark (with 28{\\%} accuracy) while state-of-the-art GPT-4 solves only 38{\\%} of puzzles. This indicates that there is still a significant gap in the deep reasoning abilities of LLMs and humans and highlights the need for further research in this area.
