To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we develop a baseline system based on modern NLP methods for human-in-the-loop fact-checking in the domain of COVID-19 treatments. We make our data and detailed annotation guidelines available to support the evaluation of human-in-the-loop systems that identify novel misinformation directly from raw user-generated content.\",\n}\n",
