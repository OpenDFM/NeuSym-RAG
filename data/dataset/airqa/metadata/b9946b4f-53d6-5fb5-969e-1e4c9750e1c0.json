The work leverages two ways, one Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) and another pre-trained language model BERTweet, to achieve robust and generalizable age classification, surpassing limitations of existing methods that rely on predefined age groups. The proposed models aim to advance the automatic extraction of self-reported exact ages from social media posts, enabling more nuanced analyses and insights into user demographics across different platforms.\",\n}\n",
