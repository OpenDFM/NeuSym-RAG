To fill this gap, we introduce the corpus (550k tokens) as an extension of Wojood, enriched with event-argument annotations. We used three types of event arguments: $agent$, $location$, and $date$, which we annotated as relation types. Our inter-annotator agreement evaluation resulted in 82.23{\\%} $Kappa$ score and 87.2{\\%} $F_1$-score. Additionally, we propose a novel method for event relation extraction using BERT, in which we treat the task as text entailment. This method achieves an $F_1$-score of 94.01{\\%}.To further evaluate the generalization of our proposed method, we collected and annotated another out-of-domain corpus (about 80k tokens) called and used it as a second test set, on which our approach achieved promising results (83.59{\\%} $F_1$-score).
