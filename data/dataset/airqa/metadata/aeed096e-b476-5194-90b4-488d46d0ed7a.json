Our proposed intent-aware FAQ retrieval consists of (1) an intent classifier that predicts whether the query is looking for an FAQ; (2) a reformulation model that rewrites query into a natural question. Offline evaluation demonstrates that our approach improves 12{\\%} in Hit@1 on retrieving ground-truth FAQs, while reducing latency by 95{\\%} compared to baseline systems. These improvements are further validated by real user feedback, where more than 99{\\%} of users consider FAQs displayed on top of product search results is helpful.
