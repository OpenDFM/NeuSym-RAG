This study proposes the generation of synthetic free-text medical reports, specifically focusing on the gastroenterology domain, to address the scarcity of specialised datasets, while preserving patient privacy. We fine-tune BioGPT on over 90 000 endoscopy reports and integrate Differential Privacy (DP) into the training process. 10 000 DP-private synthetic reports are generated by this model. The generated synthetic data is evaluated through multiple dimensions: similarity to real datasets, language quality, and utility in both supervised and semi-supervised NLP tasks. Results suggest that while DP integration impacts text quality, it offers a promising balance between data utility and privacy, improving the performance of a real-world downstream task. Our study underscores the potential of synthetic data to facilitate model development in the healthcare domain without compromising patient privacy.\",\n}\n",
