The EDOS Task consisted of three hierarchical sub-tasks: binary sexism detection in sub-task A, category of sexism detection in sub-task B and fine-grained vector of sexism detection in sub-task C. My participation in EDOS comprised fine-tuning of different layer representations of Transformer-based pre-trained language models, namely BERT, AlBERT and RoBERTa, and ensemble learning via majority voting of the best performing models. Despite the low rank mainly due to a submission error, the system employed the largest version of the aforementioned Transformer models (BERT-Large, ALBERT-XXLarge-v1, ALBERT-XXLarge-v2, RoBERTa-Large), experimented with their multi-layer structure and aggregated their predictions so as to get the final result.
