The detailed controller ensures the more detailed outline is still respected during generation by controlling story passages to align with outline details. In human evaluations of automatically generated stories, DOC substantially outperforms a strong Re3 baseline (Yang et al., 2022) on plot coherence (22.5{\\%} absolute gain), outline relevance (28.2{\\%}), and interestingness (20.7{\\%}). Humans also judged DOC to be much more controllable in an interactive generation setting.\",\n}\n",
