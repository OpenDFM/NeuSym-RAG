Moreover, the number of label categories can be up to 20 and the distribution of data is highly imbalanced. To address these issues, we employ a multi-label classification model and utilize a class-balanced loss function. Our system wins 5 first places, 2 second places, and 6 third places out of 20 categories of the Human Value Detection shared task, and our overall average score of 0.54 also places third.
