Verifier and Pruner then work together to ensure precision by correcting generation errors and determining whether newly produced tails require further iteration for the next-level KG. Experiments demonstrate that SAC-KG automatically constructs a domain KG at the scale of over one million nodes and achieves a precision of 89.32{\\%}, leading to a superior performance with over 20{\\%} increase in precision rate compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for the KG construction task.\",\n}\n",
