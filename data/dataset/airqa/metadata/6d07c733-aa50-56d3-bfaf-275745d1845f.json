    "abstract": "This paper describes our contribution to Subtask 1 of the AXOLOTL-24 Shared Task on unsupervised lexical semantic change modeling. In a joint task of word sense disambiguation and word sense induction on diachronic corpora, we significantly outperform the baseline by merging clusters of modern usage examples based on their similarities with the same historical word sense as well as their mutual similarities. We observe that multilingual sentence embeddings outperform language-specific ones in this task.",
