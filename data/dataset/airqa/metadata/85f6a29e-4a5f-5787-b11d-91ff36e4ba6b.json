In this paper, we propose a character recognition method based on an unsupervised domain adaptive network (UFCNet). Firstly, a convolutional attention fusion module (CAFM) is designed in the encoder to obtain more global features through multi-layer feature fusion.

Finally, to further improve the network{'}s ability to recognize character edges, we introduce a kernel norm-constrained loss function.
