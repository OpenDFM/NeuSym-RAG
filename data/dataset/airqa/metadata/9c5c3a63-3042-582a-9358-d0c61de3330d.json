We show that CONTRACLM enhances the discrimination of representations and bridges the gap with encoder-only models, which makes causal language models better suited for tasks beyond language generation. Specifically, we attain 44{\\%} relative improvement on the Semantic Textual Similarity tasks and 34{\\%} on Code-to-Code Search tasks. Furthermore, by improving the expressiveness of representations, CONTRACLM also boosts the source code generation capability with 9{\\%} relative improvement on execution accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark.\",\n}\n",
