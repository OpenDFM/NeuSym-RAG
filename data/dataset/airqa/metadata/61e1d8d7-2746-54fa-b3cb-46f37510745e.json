Traditional methods for authorship obfuscation face significant challenges in balancing content preservation, fluency, and style concealment. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Obfuscation Strategy Optimizer (OSO), which dynamically selects the optimal obfuscation technique based on a combination of metrics including embedding distance, meaning similarity, and fluency. By leveraging an ensemble of language models OSO achieves superior performance in preserving the original content{'}s meaning and grammatical fluency while effectively concealing the author{'}s unique writing style. Experimental results demonstrate that the OSO outperforms existing methods and approaches the performance of larger language models. Our evaluation framework incorporates adversarial testing against state-of-the-art attribution systems to validate the robustness of the obfuscation techniques.
