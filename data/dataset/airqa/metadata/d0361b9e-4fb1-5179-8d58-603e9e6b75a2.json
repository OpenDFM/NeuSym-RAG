In first step of extraction phase, we extract all the potential ADEs with in-context few-shot learning. In the second step for extraction, we let GLM to filer out false positive outputs in the first step by a tailored prompt. Then we normalize each ADE to its MedDRA preferred term ID (ptID) by an ensemble method using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our method achieved excellent recall rate. It obtained 41.1{\\%}, 42.8{\\%}, and 40.6{\\%} recall rate for ADE normalization, ADE recognition, and normalization for unseen ADEs, respectively.
