WojoodNER-2024 encompassed three subtasks: ($i$) Closed-Track Flat Fine-Grained NER, ($ii$) Closed-Track Nested Fine-Grained NER, and ($iii$) an Open-Track NER for the Israeli War on Gaza. A total of 43 unique teams registered for this shared task. Five teams participated in the Flat Fine-Grained Subtask, among which two teams tackled the Nested Fine-Grained Subtask and one team participated in the Open-Track NER Subtask. The winning teams achieved $F_1$ scores of 91{\\%} and 92{\\%} in the Flat Fine-Grained and Nested Fine-Grained Subtasks, respectively.
