To address this limitation, we propose a U2S generator that incorporates a distillation with no label (DINO) self-supervised training strategy into it{'}s pretraining process.Because the proposed method captures noise-agnostic expressivity representation, it can generate qualified speech even in noisy environment.Objective and subjective evaluation results verified that the proposed method significantly improved the performance of the expressive S2ST system in noisy environments while maintaining competitive performance in clean environments.\",\n}\n",
