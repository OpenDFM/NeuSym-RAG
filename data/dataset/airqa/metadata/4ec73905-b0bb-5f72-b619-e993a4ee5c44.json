We have participated in both the subtask 1: News Genre Categorisation, and the subtask 3: Persuasion Techniques Detection. Our solutions are based on two-stage fine-tuned multilingual models. We evaluated our approach on the 9 languages provided in the task. Our results show that the use of transfer learning from media bias detection to persuasion techniques detection is beneficial for the subtask of detecting the genre (macro F1-score of 0.523 in the English test set) as it improves previous results, but not for the detection of persuasive techniques (micro F1-score of 0.24 in the English test set).\",\n}\n",
