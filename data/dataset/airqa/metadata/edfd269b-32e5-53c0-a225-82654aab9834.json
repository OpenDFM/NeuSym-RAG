To address this issue, the authors have implemented a sequential sentence classification process, which categorizes legal documents into 13 segments, known as Rhetorical Roles. This approach enables the extraction of valuable insights from the various classes of the structured document. The performance of this approach was evaluated using the F1 score, which measures the model{'}s precision and recall.
