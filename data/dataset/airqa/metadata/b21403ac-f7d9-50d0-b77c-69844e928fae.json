We have investigated both single-task and multi-task learning based on RoBERTa transformer-based language models. For improving the results, we have performed further pre-training of RoBERTa on the provided unlabeled data. Besides, we have employed a small sample of the unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning using the minimum class-confusion loss.
