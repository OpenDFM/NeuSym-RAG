Existing benchmarking tasks often require models to identify the temporal validity duration of a single statement. However, many data sources contain additional context, such as successive sentences in a story or posts on a social media profile. This context may alter the duration for which the originally collected statement is expected to be valid. We propose Temporal Validity Change Prediction, a natural language processing task benchmarking the capability of machine learning models to detect context statements that induce such change. We create a dataset consisting of temporal target statements sourced from Twitter and crowdsource corresponding context statements. We then benchmark a set of transformer-based language models on our dataset. Finally, we experiment with a multitasking approach to improve the state-of-the-art performance.\",\n}\n",
