Therefore, this paper proposes a System of Ensembling Fine-tuning Models (SEFM) at SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection of Online Sexism. We firstly use four task-adaptive pre-trained language models to flag all texts. Secondly, we alleviate the data imbalance from two perspectives: over-sampling the labelled data and adjusting the loss function. Thirdly, we add indicators and feedback modules to enhance the overall performance. Our system attained macro F1 scores of 0.8538, 0.6619, and 0.4641 for Subtask A, B, and C, respectively. Our system exhibited strong performance across multiple tasks, with particularly noteworthy performance in Subtask B. Comparison experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.\",\n}\n",
