The annotation process involved categorizing the dataset based on identified biases, following a set of guidelines in which categories of bias were defined by the team. The findings revealed that most of the media texts provided for analysis included bias against Palestine, whether it was through the use of biased vocabulary or even tone. It was also found that texts written in Hebrew contained the most bias against Palestine. In addition, when comparing annotations done by AAI-1 and AAI-2, the results turned out to be very similar, which might be mainly due to the clear annotation guidelines set by the annotators themselves. Thus, we recommend the use of clear guidelines to facilitate the process of annotation by future researchers.\",\n}\n",
