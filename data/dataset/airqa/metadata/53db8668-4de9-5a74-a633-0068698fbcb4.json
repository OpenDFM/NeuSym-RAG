However, extracting the relevant context from the paper is challenging because the relevant parts are scattered in the main text and captions.This study defines a rule-based method for extracting broad context from the main text, including table captions and sentences that mention the table.Furthermore, we propose synthetic context as a more refined context generated by large language models (LLMs).In a synthetic context, contexts from the entire paper are refined by summarizing, injecting supplemental knowledge, and clarifying the referent concept.We observe this approach improves accuracy for EL by more than 10 points on the S2abEL dataset, and our qualitative analysis suggests potential future works.\",\n}\n",
