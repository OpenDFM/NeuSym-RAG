The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve scalability and higher scores.
