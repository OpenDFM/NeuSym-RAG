For both the conditions, we build end-to-end speech translation networks comprising of a conformer encoder and a transformer decoder. Under both the conditions, we leverage Marathi Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) data to pre-train the encoder and subsequently train the entire model on the speech translation data. Our results demonstrate that pre-training the encoder with ASR data is a key step in significantly improving the speech translation performance. We also show that conformer encoders are inherently superior to its transformer counterparts for speech translation tasks.
