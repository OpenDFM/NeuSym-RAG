This research explores methods for identifying animate entities visually in comics using annotation experiments. Two rounds of inter-annotator agreement experiments are run: the first asks annotators to outline areas on comic pages using a Polygon segmentation tool, and the second prompts annotators to assign each outlined entity{'}s animacy type to derive a quantitative measure of agreement. The first experiment results show that Polygon-based outlines successfully produce a qualitative measure of agreement; the second experiment supports that animacy status is best conceptualised as a graded, rather than binary, concept.\",\n}\n",
