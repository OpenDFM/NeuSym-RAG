In order to better understand how sentiment regarding persons and organizations (each entity in our scope) is expressed in longer texts, we have collected a dataset of expert annotations where the overall sentiment regarding each entity is identified, together with the sentence-level sentiment for these entities separately. We show that the reader{'}s perceived sentiment regarding an entity often differs from an arithmetic aggregation of sentiments at the sentence level. Only 70{\\%} of the positive and 55{\\%} of the negative entities receive a correct overall sentiment label when we aggregate the (human-annotated) sentiment labels for the sentences where the entity is mentioned.
