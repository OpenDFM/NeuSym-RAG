This paper proposes a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to produce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and humans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model like BART to generate error-free connection sentences, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance between relevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Evaluation results on the MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM outperforms strong baselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents. Furthermore, the separation of adversarial text generation from the surrogate NRM makes IDEM more robust and less affected by the quality of the surrogate NRM.\",\n}\n",
