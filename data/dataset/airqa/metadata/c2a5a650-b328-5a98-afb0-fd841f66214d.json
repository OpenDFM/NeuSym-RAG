Our approach consists of fine-tuning BERT-based models efficiently for both, Single-Task Learning as well as Multi-Task Learning, the details of which are discussed. Finally, an ensemble was implemented on the best-performing models to maximize overall performance. We achieved a macro F1 score of 78.02{\\%} in this shared task.
