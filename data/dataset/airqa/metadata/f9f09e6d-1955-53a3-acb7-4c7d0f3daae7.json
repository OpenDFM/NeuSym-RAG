In this paper, we present a new approach to understanding legal texts, which are normally long documents, based on data-oriented methods. Specifically, we first try to exploit the characteristic of data to understand the legal texts. The output is then used to train the model using the Longformer architecture. Regarding the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated on the sub-task CJPE of the SemEval-2023 Task 6. Accordingly, our method achieves top 1 and top 2 on the classification task and explanation task, respectively. Furthermore, we present several open research issues for further investigations in order to improve the performance in this research field.\",\n}\n",
