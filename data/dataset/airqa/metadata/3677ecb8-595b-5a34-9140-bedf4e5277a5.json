Specifically, PREADD contrasts the output logits generated using a raw prompt against those generated using a prefix-prepended prompt, enabling both positive and negative control with respect to any attribute encapsulated by the prefix. We evaluate PREADD on three tasks{---}toxic output mitigation, gender bias reduction, and sentiment control{---}and find that PREADD outperforms not only prompting baselines, but also an auxiliary-expert control method, by 12{\\%} or more in relative gain on our main metrics for each task.\",\n}\n",
