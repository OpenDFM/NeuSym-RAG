    "abstract": "Computer-assisted approaches to historical and typological language comparison have made great progress over the past two decades. Specifically for the classical tasks of historical language comparison, many computational methods have been published that mimic certain steps of the traditional workflow of the comparative method. In contrast to the diversity of new computational methods, there is only a limited number of interactive tools and interfaces that help scholars to curate and refine their data both before and after the application of computational methods. One of the few publicly available interfaces is EDICTOR (https://edictor.org), an interactive tool for computer-assisted language comparison. EDICTOR has been around for some time, and allows scholars to annotate and align cognate sets in various ways. With EDICTOR 3, the original tool has been enhanced, offering not only new features for data annotation, but also providing the possibility to use purely automatic methods for initial cognate detection, phonetic alignment, and correspondence pattern inference in an integrated workflow.",
