Motivated by the society of minds (Minsky, 1988), we propose ReConcile, a multi-model multi-agent framework designed as a round table conference among diverse LLM agents. ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a {`}discussion prompt{'} that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs{'} reasoning {--} both individually and as a team {--} surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4{\\%} and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8{\\%} improvement on MATH. Finally, we analyze the individual components of ReConcile, demonstrating that the diversity originating from different models is critical to its superior performance.\",\n}\n",

ReConcile enhances collaborative reasoning between LLM agents via multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism that leads to a better consensus. In each round, ReConcile initiates discussion between agents via a ‘discussion prompt’ that consists of (a) grouped answers and explanations generated by each agent in the previous round, (b) their confidence scores, and (c) demonstrations of answer-rectifying human explanations, used for convincing other agents. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ReConcile significantly improves LLMs’ reasoning – both individually and as a team – surpassing prior single-agent and multi-agent baselines by up to 11.4% and even outperforming GPT-4 on three datasets. ReConcile also flexibly incorporates different combinations of agents, including API-based, open-source, and domain-specific models, leading to an 8% improvement on MATH.
