In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE{'}s generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads{'} best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE{'}s context size. Experiments on long sequence language modeling, the synthetic passkey retrieval task and real-world long context tasks show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art length generalization algorithms.
