In this paper, we introduce ClinicalRAG, a novel multi-agent pipeline to rectify this issue by incorporating heterogeneous medical knowledge{---}both structured and unstructured{---}into LLMs to bolster diagnosis accuracy. ClinicalRAG can extract related medical entities from user inputs and dynamically integrate relevant medical knowledge during the text generation process. Comparative analyses reveal that ClinicalRAG significantly outperforms knowledge-deficient methods, offering enhanced reliability in clinical decision support. This advancement marks a pivotal proof-of-concept step towards mitigating misinformation risks in healthcare applications of LLMs.\",\n}\n",
