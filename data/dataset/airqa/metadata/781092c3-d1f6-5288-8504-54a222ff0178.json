It would be desirable if the models can stimulate prompting knowledge while adaptation to specific NLU tasks. We present the Adversarial Knowledge Stimulated Contrastive Prompting (AKSCP) framework, leading to better few-shot NLU tasks for language models by implicitly stimulate knowledge from pretrained language model. In AKSCP, a novel paradigm Cloze-driven prompt is proposed for joint prompt tuning across word cloze task and prompt-based learning, forcing PLMs to stimulate prompting knowledge. We further design an Adversarial Contrastive learning method to improve the generalization ability of PLM for different downstream tasks. Experiments over a variety of NLU tasks show that AKSCP consistently outperforms state-of-the-arts for prompt-based fine-tuning.\",\n}\n",
