Task C aims for an even more fine-grained classification, divided among 11 classes. Our team UniBoe{'}s experiments with fine-tuning of hate-tuned Transformer-based models and priming for generative models. In addition, we explore model-agnostic strategies, such as data augmentation techniques combined with active learning, as well as obfuscation of identity terms.
