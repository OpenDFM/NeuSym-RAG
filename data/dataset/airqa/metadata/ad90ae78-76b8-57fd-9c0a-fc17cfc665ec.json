We proposed a cascaded solution consisting of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and a machine translation (MT) model. It was noted that the ASR model employed the pre-trained Whisper-large-v3 model to process the speech data, while the MT model adopted the Transformer architecture. To improve the quality of the MT model, it was stated that our system utilized not only the data provided by the competition but also an additional 54 million parallel sentences. Ultimately, we reported that our final system achieved a BLEU score of 24.7 for apc-to-English translation.\",\n}\n",
