The testing dataset also had unseen languages such as Hindi, Arabic, Dutch and Korean. The tweets may or may not be related to intimacy. The task of our team was to score the intimacy in tweets and place it in the range of 05 based on the level of intimacy in the tweet using the dataset provided which consisted of tweets along with its scores. The intimacy score is used to indicate whether a tweet is intimate or not. Our team participated in the task and proposed the ROBERTa model to analyse the intimacy of the tweets.\",\n}\n",
