In recent years, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a potential for unsupervised DG without expensive human-annotated distractor labels. In this paper, we leverage LLMs as a cost-effective annotator to enhance the DG capability of smaller student models. To perform knowledge distilling, we propose a dual task training framework that integrates pseudo distractors from LLMs and answer information as the objective target with a two-stage training process. Moreover, we devise a counterfactual contrastive decoding mechanism for increasing the distracting capability of the DG model. Experiments show that our unsupervised generation method with Bart-base greatly surpasses GPT-3.5-turbo zero-shot performance with only 200$\\times$ fewer model parameters. Our proposed unsupervised DG method offers a cost-effective framework for practical reading comprehension applications, without the need of laborious distractor annotation and costly large-size models.\",\n}\n",
