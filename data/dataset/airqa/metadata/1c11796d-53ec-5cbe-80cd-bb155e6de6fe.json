This paper presents an empirical study on adversarial attacks against T2I models, focusing on analyzing factors associated with attack success rates (ASR). We introduce a new attack objective - entity swapping using adversarial suffixes and two gradient-based attack algorithms. Human and automatic evaluations reveal the asymmetric nature of ASRs on entity swap: for example, it is easier to replace {``}human{''} with {``}robot{''} in the prompt {``}a human dancing in the rain.{''} with an adversarial suffix, but the reverse replacement is significantly harder. We further propose probing metrics to establish indicative signals from the model{'}s beliefs to the adversarial ASR. We identify conditions that result in a success probability of 60{\\%} for adversarial attacks and others where this likelihood drops below 5{\\%}.
