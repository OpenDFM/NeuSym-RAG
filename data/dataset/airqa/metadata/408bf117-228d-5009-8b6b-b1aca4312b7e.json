The key metric to maximize is the precision for CSAT = 1 (lowestCSAT). We maximize this metric in two ways. First, reframing the problemas a binary class, rather than five-class problem during model fine-tuning, and then mapping binary outcomes back to five classes usingtemperature-scaled model probabilities.
