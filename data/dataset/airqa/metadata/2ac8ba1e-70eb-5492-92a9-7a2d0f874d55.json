Techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation have been developed to reduce their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models. Different from common approaches that prune each attention head as a whole, GRAIN inspects and prunes intra-attention structures, which greatly expands the structure search space and enables more flexible models. We also propose a gradient separation strategy that reduces the interference of distillation on pruning for a better combination of the two approaches. Experiments on GLUE, SQuAD, and CoNLL 2003 show that GRAIN notably outperforms other methods, especially in the high sparsity regime, and achieves 6 7x speedups while maintaining 93{\\%} 99{\\%} performance.
