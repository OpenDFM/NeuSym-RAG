Our framework alternates between updating two language models{---}an elaboration generator and an answer predictor{---}allowing each to influence the other. Using less than 0.5{\\%} of the parameters of GPT-3, our model outperforms alternatives with similar sizes and closes the gap with GPT-3 on four commonsense question answering benchmarks.
