Our approach focuses on addressing class imbalance through data augmentation, hierarchical classification, and the application of focal loss and weighted cross-entropy loss functions. These methods enhance our transformer-based model{'}s ability to transfer emotion detection capabilities across languages, resulting in improved performance despite the constraints of limited computational resources.\",\n}\n",
