In this paper, we tackle the absence of explicit semantic grounding in MLM and propose Descriptive Masked Language Modeling (DMLM), a knowledge-enhanced reading comprehension objective, where the model is required to predict the most likely word in a context, being provided with the word{'}s definition. For instance, given the sentence {``}I was going to the {\\_}{''}, if we provided as definition {``}financial institution{''}, the model would have to predict the word {``}bank{''}; if, instead, we provided {``}sandy seashore{''}, the model should predict {``}beach{''}. Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of DMLM in comparison with standard MLM, showing improvements on a number of well-established NLU benchmarks, as well as other semantics-focused tasks, e.g., Semantic Role Labeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate how it is possible to take full advantage of DMLM to embed explicit semantics in downstream tasks, explore several properties of DMLM-based contextual representations and suggest a number of future directions to investigate.\",\n}\n",
