We observe that the query vocabulary is distinct from human vocabulary. Language Models (LMs) are pre-dominantly trained for human language tasks, and hence, if the query vocabulary is replaced with a vocabulary more attuned to the LM tokenizer, the performance of models may improve. We carry out carefully selected vocabulary substitutions on the queries and find absolute gains in the range of 17{\\%} on the GrailQA dataset.\",\n}\n",
