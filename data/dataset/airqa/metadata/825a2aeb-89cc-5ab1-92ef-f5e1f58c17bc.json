However, conventional domain adaptation methods often cannot be applied due to data sharing restrictions on source data. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses this issue by only utilizing a source model and unlabeled target data to adapt to the target domain. In SFDA, self-training is the most widely applied method involving retraining models with target data using predictions from the source model as pseudo-labels. Nevertheless, this approach is prone to contain substantial numbers of errors in pseudo-labeling and might limit model performance in the target domain. In this paper, we propose a Source-Free Prototype-based Self-training (SFPS) aiming to improve the performance of self-training. SFPS generates prototypes without accessing source data and utilizes them for prototypical learning, namely prototype-based pseudo-labeling and contrastive learning. Also, we compare entropy-based, centroid-based, and class-weights-based prototype generation methods to identify the most effective formulation of the proposed method. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, consistently outperforming vanilla self-training. The comparison of various prototype-generation methods identifies the most reliable generation method that improves the source model persistently. Additionally, our analysis illustrates SFPS can successfully alleviate errors in pseudo-labeling.\",\n}\n",
