To this end, we investigate the parameter-efficient tuning (PETuning) of PLMs and develop a corresponding federated benchmark for four representative PETuning methods, dubbed FedPETuning. Specifically, FedPETuning provides the first holistic empirical study of representative PLMs tuning methods in FL, covering privacy attacks, performance comparisons, and resource-constrained analysis. Intensive experimental results have indicated that FedPETuning can efficiently defend against privacy attacks and maintains acceptable performance with reducing heavy resource consumption.
