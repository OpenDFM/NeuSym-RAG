However, there remains a performance gap in this area between existing open-source models and closed-source models such as GPT-4. In this paper, we introduce MathGenie, a novel method for generating diverse and reliable math problems by leveraging the ground-truth solutions of the seed data. We augment these ground-truth solutions and use a specially finetuned model to translate these augmented solutions back into new questions. Subsequently, we generate code-integrated solutions for these questions. To ensure the correctness of the code-integrated solutions, we employ rationale-based verification for filtering. Then, we finetune various pretrained models, ranging from 7B to 70B, on the newly curated data, resulting in a family of models known as MathGenie. These models consistently outperform previous open-source models across five representative mathematical reasoning datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. In particular, MathGenie-InternLM2 achieves an accuracy of 87.7{\\%} on GSM8K and 55.7{\\%} on MATH, securing the best overall score.\",\n}\n",
