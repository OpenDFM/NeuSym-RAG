We study each adaptation strategy separately, as well as the combined performance improvement through ablation experiments and an extensive set of evaluations run over seven adaptation domains. Our combined adaptation approach consistently outperforms purely parametric adaptation and zero-shot (kNN-LM) baselines that construct datastores from the adaptation data. On average, we see perplexity improvements of 17.1{\\%} and 16{\\%} for these respective baselines, across domains.\",\n}\n",
