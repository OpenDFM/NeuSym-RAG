MMCAP advances the fusion of visual and textual medical knowledge via a graph attention network and a transformer decoder. Additionally, it incorporates a Type Conditional Prompt in the fine-tuning phase, markedly boosting the accuracy and relevance of answers to open-ended questions. Our tests on benchmark datasets illustrate MMCAP{'}s superiority over existing methods, demonstrating its high efficiency in data-limited settings and effective knowledge-image alignment capability.\",\n}\n",
