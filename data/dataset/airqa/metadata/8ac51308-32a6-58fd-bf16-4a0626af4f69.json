Dialogue is an important medium that communicates and delivers persona information. Although there is a public dataset for triplet-based persona attribute extraction from conversations, its automatically generated labels present many issues, including unspecific relations and inconsistent annotations. We fix such issues by leveraging more reliable text-label matching criteria to generate high-quality data for persona attribute extraction. We also propose a contrastive learning- and generation-based model with a novel hard negative sampling strategy for generalized zero-shot persona attribute extraction. We benchmark our model with state-of-the-art baselines on our dataset and a public dataset, showing outstanding accuracy gains. Our sampling strategy also exceeds others by a large margin in persona attribute extraction.\",\n}\n",
