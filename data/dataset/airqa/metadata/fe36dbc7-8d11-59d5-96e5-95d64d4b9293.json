Current detection methods tend to aggregate features from individual modalities into multimodal features, overlooking the implicit opinions and the evolving nature of opinions across modalities. In this paper, we mine implicit opinions within short video news and promote the evolution of both explicit and implicit opinions across all modalities. Specifically, we design a prompt template to mine implicit opinions regarding the credibility of news from the textual component of videos. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model that encourages the interplay among diverse modal opinions, including those extracted through our implicit opinion prompts. Experimental results on a publicly available dataset for short video fake news detection demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods.\",\n}\n",
