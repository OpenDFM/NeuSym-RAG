Recent works tackled this task by improving query inputs with large pre-trained language models (PLM), at the cost of more expensive training. However, the effects of this integration are unclear, as these works also propose improvements in the visual inputs. Therefore, this paper studies the role of query sentence representation with PLMs in TVG and assesses the applicability of parameter-efficient training with NLP adapters. We couple popular PLMs with a selection of existing approaches and test different adapters to reduce the impact of the additional parameters. Our results on three challenging datasets show that, with the same visual inputs, TVG models greatly benefited from the PLM integration and fine-tuning, stressing the importance of the text query representation in this task. Furthermore, adapters were an effective alternative to full fine-tuning, even though they are not tailored to our task, allowing PLM integration in larger TVG models and delivering results comparable to SOTA models. Finally, our results shed light on which adapters work best in different scenarios.\",\n}\n",
