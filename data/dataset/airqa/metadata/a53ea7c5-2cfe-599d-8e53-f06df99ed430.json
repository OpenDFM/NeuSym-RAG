To enhance sample efficiency within resource-constrained, imperfect teacher scenarios, we propose a three-component framework leveraging three signal types. The first signal is the student{'}s self-consistency (consistency of student multiple outputs), which is a proxy of the student{'}s confidence. Specifically, we introduce a {''}teaching assistant{''} (TA) model to assess the uncertainty of both the student{'}s and the teacher{'}s outputs via confidence scoring, which serves as another two signals for student training. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training schema to first warm up the student with a small proportion of data to better utilize student{'}s signal. Experiments have shown the superiority of our proposed framework for four complex reasoning tasks. On average, our proposed two-stage framework brings a relative improvement of up to 20.79{\\%} compared to fine-tuning without any signals across datasets.\",\n}\n",

The first signal is the student’s self-consistency (consistency of student multiple outputs), which is a proxy of the student’s confidence. Specifically, we introduce a ”teaching assistant” (TA) model to assess the uncertainty of both the student’s and the teacher’s outputs via confidence scoring, which serves as another two signals for student training.
