To address these limitations, we propose a novel Customized Text sanitization (CusText) mechanism based on the original $\\epsilon$-differential privacy (DP) definition, which is compatible with any similarity measure.Moreover, CusText assigns each input token a customized output set to provide more advanced privacy protection at the token level.Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that CusText achieves a better trade-off between privacy and utility than existing mechanisms.The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/sai4july/CusText}.\",\n}\n",
