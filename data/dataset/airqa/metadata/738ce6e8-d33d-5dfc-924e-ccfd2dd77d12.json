Here, the Dungeon Master (DM), i.e., the teacher, guides the actions of several players{---}students, each with their own personas and abilities{---}to achieve shared goals grounded in a fantasy world. Our approach is to decompose and model these interactions into (1) the DM{'}s intent to guide players toward a given goal; (2) the DM{'}s guidance utterance to the players expressing this intent; and (3) a theory-of-mind (ToM) model that anticipates the players{'} reaction to the guidance one turn into the future. We develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method for training a DM that generates guidance for players by rewarding utterances where the intent matches the ToM-anticipated player actions. Human and automated evaluations show that a DM trained to explicitly model intents and incorporate ToM of the players using RL generates better-quality guidance that is 3x more likely to fulfill the DM{'}s intent than a vanilla natural language generation (NLG) approach.\",\n}\n",
