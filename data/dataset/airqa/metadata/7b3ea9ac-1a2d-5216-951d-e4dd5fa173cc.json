The evaluation results show that our final submissions are competitive, in particular outperforming the submissions by other participants by 5{\\%} absolute as measured by the SubER subtitle quality metric. For the formality track, we participate with our En-Ru and En-Pt production models, which support formality control via prefix tokens. Except for informal Portuguese, we achieve near perfect formality level accuracy while at the same time offering high general translation quality.\",\n}\n",
