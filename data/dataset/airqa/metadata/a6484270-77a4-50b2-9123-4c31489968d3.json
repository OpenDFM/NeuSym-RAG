The lack of context makes the recognition of ambiguous named entities challenging. To alleviate this issue, our team SRCB proposes an external knowledge based system, where we utilize 3 different types of external knowledge retrieved in different ways. Given an original text, our system retrieves the possible labels and the descriptions for each potential entity detected by a mention detection model. And we also retrieve a related document as extra context from Wikipedia for each original text. We concatenate the original text with the external knowledge as the input of NER models. The informative contextual representations with external knowledge significantly improve the NER performance in both Chinese and English tracks. Our system win the 3rd place in the Chinese track and the 6th place in the English track.\",\n}\n",
