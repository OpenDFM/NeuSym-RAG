In this paper, we propose fMRI2text, the first open-vocabulary task aiming to bridge fMRI time series and human language.

By reconstructing both individual time points and time series, UniCoRN establishes a robust encoder for cognitive signals (fMRI {\\&} EEG). Leveraging a pre-trained language model as decoder, UniCoRN proves its efficacy in decoding coherent text from fMRI series across various split settings. Our model achieves a 34.77{\\%} BLEU score on fMRI2text, and a 37.04{\\%} BLEU when generalized to EEG-to-text decoding, thereby surpassing the former baseline. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of decoding consecutive fMRI volumes, and the effectiveness of decoding different cognitive signals using a unified structure.\",\n}\n",
