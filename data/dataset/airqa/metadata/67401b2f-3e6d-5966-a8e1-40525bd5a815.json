To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textit{CharacterEval}, a Chinese benchmark for comprehensive RPCA assessment, complemented by a tailored high-quality dataset. The dataset comprises 1,785 multi-turn role-playing dialogues, encompassing 11,376 examples and featuring 77 characters derived from Chinese novels and scripts. It was carefully constructed, beginning with initial dialogue extraction via GPT-4, followed by rigorous human-led quality control, and enhanced with in-depth character profiles sourced from Baidu Baike. \\textit{CharacterEval} employs a multifaceted evaluation approach, encompassing thirteen targeted metrics on four dimensions. To facilitate the convenient evaluation for these subjective metrics in \\textit{CharacterEval}, we further developed CharacterRM, a role-playing reward model based on human annotations, which has a higher correlation with human judgment compared to GPT-4. Comprehensive experiments on \\textit{CharacterEval} demonstrate that Chinese LLMs exhibit more promising capabilities than GPT-4 in Chinese role-playing conversation.\",\n}\n",
