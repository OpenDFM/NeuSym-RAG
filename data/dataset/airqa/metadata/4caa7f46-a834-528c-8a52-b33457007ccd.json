In this paper, we introduce UKP-SQuARE as a platform for QA education. This platform provides an interactive environment where students can run, compare, and analyze various QA models from different perspectives, such as general behavior, explainability, and robustness. Therefore, students can get a first-hand experience in different QA techniques during the class. Thanks to this, we propose a learner-centered approach for QA education in which students proactively learn theoretical concepts and acquire problem-solving skills through interactive exploration, experimentation, and practical assignments, rather than solely relying on traditional lectures. To evaluate the effectiveness of UKP-SQuARE in teaching scenarios, we adopted it in a postgraduate NLP course and surveyed the students after the course. Their positive feedback shows the platform{'}s effectiveness in their course and invites a wider adoption.\",\n}\n",
