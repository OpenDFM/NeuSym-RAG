In our experiments, we design tailored setups to test the model{'}s generalization abilities. We find our PCFG-based command generation approach is effective for handling unseen commands compared to fix-set templates. Further, our proposed NL models can effectively generalize to unseen attributes (a new ability enabled by the NL interface), as well as unseen attribute combinations. Interestingly, in model comparisons, the simple conditional generation approach, enhanced with our proposed NL interface, is shown to be a strong baseline in those challenging settings.\",\n}\n",
