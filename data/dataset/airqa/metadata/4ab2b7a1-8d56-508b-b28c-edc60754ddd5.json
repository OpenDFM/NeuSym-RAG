Therefore, the policy determines the number of source tokens read during the translation of each target token.

In this paper, we present a new method for constructing the optimal policy online via binary search. By employing explicit supervision, our approach enables the SiMT model to learn the optimal policy, which can guide the model in completing the translation during inference.
