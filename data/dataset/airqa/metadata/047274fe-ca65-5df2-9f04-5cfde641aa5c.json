We evaluate our framework in the context of people from India, working with two languages: English and Hindi. We work with frameworks built around mCLIP-based models to ensure a thorough evaluation of recent state-of-the-art models in the multilingual setting due to their potential for widespread applications. We analyze the results across 50 traits for retrieval and 8 traits for generation, showing that current multilingual multimodal models are biased towards men for most traits, and this problem is further exacerbated for lower-resource languages like Hindi. We further discuss potential reasons behind this observation, particularly stemming from the bias introduced by the pretraining datasets.\",\n}\n",
