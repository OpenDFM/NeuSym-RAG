Since translation, rotation, and scaling operations are cascaded to form a composite one, the new model is named CompoundE. By casting CompoundE in the framework of group theory, we show that quite a few distanced-based KGE models are special cases of CompoundE. CompoundE extends the simple distance-based scoring functions to relation-dependent compound operations on head and/or tail entities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CompoundE, we perform three prevalent KG prediction tasks including link prediction, path query answering, and entity typing, on a range of datasets. CompoundE outperforms extant models consistently, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility.\",\n}\n",
