To extend this research, we introduce MemeMQA, a multimodal question-answering framework aiming to solicit accurate responses to structured questions while providing coherent explanations. We curate MemeMQACorpus, a new dataset featuring 1,880 questions related to 1,122 memes with corresponding answer-explanation pairs.

We analyze ARSENAL{'}s robustness through diversification of question-set, confounder-based evaluation regarding MemeMQA{'}s generalizability, and modality-specific assessment, enhancing our understanding of meme interpretation in the multimodal communication landscape.\",\n}\n",
