Inspired by prior work on template-based report generation, both teams focused on exploring various template-based strategies, using predictions from multi-label image classifiers as input. Our best approach achieved a modest F1-RadGraph score of 19.42 on the findings hidden test set, ranking 7th on the leaderboard. Notably, we consistently observed a discrepancy between our classification metrics and the F1-CheXbert metric reported on the leaderboard, which always showed lower scores. This suggests that the F1-CheXbert metric may be missing some of the labels mentioned by the templates.\",\n}\n",
