The tweets were collected based on a list of stop words to prevent topical or emotional bias and were subsequently manually annotated. For both tasks, only a training corpus for English was provided, obliging participating systems to design cross-lingual approaches. Our shared task received submissions from 14 teams for the emotion detection task and from 6 teams for the trigger word detection task. The highest macro F1-scores obtained for both tasks are respectively 0.629 and 0.616, demonstrating that cross-lingual emotion detection is still a challenging task.\",\n}\n",
