In this study, we introduce a shared task aimed at addressing this challenge, which attracted 271 submissions, yielding only a handful of promising approaches. This paper presents the datasets, the most effective methods, and an experimental analysis in error-correcting HTRed manuscripts and papyri in Byzantine Greek, the language that followed Classical and preceded Modern Greek. By using recognised and transcribed data from seven centuries, the two best-performing methods are compared, one based on a neural encoder-decoder architecture and the other based on engineered linguistic rules. We show that the recognition error rate can be reduced by both, up to 2.5 points at the level of characters and up to 15 at the level of words, while also elucidating their respective strengths and weaknesses.\",\n}\n",
