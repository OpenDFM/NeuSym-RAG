We introduce two key modifications to this model which encourage more disentangled representations and improve its compute and memory efficiency, allowing us to tackle compositional generalization in a more realistic setting. Specifically, instead of adaptively re-encoding source keys and values at each time step, we disentangle their representations and only re-encode keys periodically, at some interval. Our new architecture leads to better generalization performance across existing tasks and datasets, and a new machine translation benchmark which we create by detecting naturally occurring compositional patterns in relation to a training set. We show this methodology better emulates real-world requirements than artificial challenges.\",\n}\n",
