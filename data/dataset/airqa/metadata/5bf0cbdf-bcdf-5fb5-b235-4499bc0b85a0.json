Although knowledge distillation techniques have been widely utilized for uni-modal model compression, how to expand them to the situation when the numbers of modalities and teachers/students are doubled has been rarely studied. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments on this topic and propose the fully-Connected knowledge interaction graph (Coca) technique for cross-modal pre-training distillation. Based on our findings, the resulting CocaCLIP achieves SOTA performances on the widely-used Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks under the lightweight setting.
