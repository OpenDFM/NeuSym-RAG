Further, we show acceptance rate grows for submissions with more Yes responses. We find that the 44{\\%} of submissions that gather new data are 5{\\%} less likely to be accepted than those that did not; the average reviewer-rated reproducibility of these submissions is also 2{\\%} lower relative to the rest. We find that only 46{\\%} of submissions claim to open-source their code, though submissions that do have 8{\\%} higher reproducibility score relative to those that do not, the most for any item. We discuss what can be inferred about the state of reproducibility in NLP, and provide a set of recommendations for future conferences, including: a) allowing submitting code and appendices one week after the deadline, and b) measuring dataset reproducibility by a checklist of data collection practices.\",\n}\n",
