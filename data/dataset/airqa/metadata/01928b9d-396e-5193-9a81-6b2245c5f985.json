In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.\",\n}\n",
