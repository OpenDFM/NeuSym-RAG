To this end, we leverage the inherent nature of the year-to-year structure of reports to define a novel signal-highlighting task; more importantly, we propose a compare-and-contrast multistage pipeline that recognizes different relationships between the reports and locates relevant rationales for these relationships. We also create and publicly release a human-annotated dataset for our task. Our experiments on the dataset validate the effectiveness of our pipeline, and we provide detailed analyses and ablation studies to support our findings.\",\n}\n",
