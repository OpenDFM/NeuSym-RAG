Conventional approaches to QE involve training separate models at different levels of granularity viz., word-level, sentence-level, and document-level, which sometimes lead to inconsistent predictions for the same input. To overcome this limitation, we focus on jointly training a single model for sentence-level and word-level QE tasks in a multi-task learning framework. Using two multi-task learning-based QE approaches, we show that multi-task learning improves the performance of both tasks. We evaluate these approaches by performing experiments in different settings, viz., single-pair, multi-pair, and zero-shot. We compare the multi-task learning-based approach with baseline QE models trained on single tasks and observe an improvement of up to 4.28{\\%} in Pearson{'}s correlation (r) at sentence-level and 8.46{\\%} in F1-score at word-level, in the single-pair setting. In the multi-pair setting, we observe improvements of up to 3.04{\\%} at sentence-level and 13.74{\\%} at word-level; while in the zero-shot setting, we also observe improvements of up to 5.26{\\%} and 3.05{\\%}, respectively.
