In this paper, we present {``}BlockNet{''}, a fusion framework that summarizes block diagrams by integrating local and global information, catering to both English and Korean languages. Additionally, we introduce a new multilingual method to produce block diagram data, resulting in a high-quality dataset called {``}BD-EnKo{''}. In BlockNet, we develop {``}BlockSplit{''}, an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) based algorithm employing the divide-and-conquer principle for local information extraction. We train an OCR-free transformer architecture for global information extraction using BD-EnKo and public data. To assess the effectiveness of our model, we conduct thorough experiments on different datasets. The assessment shows that BlockNet surpasses all previous methods and models, including GPT-4V, for block diagram summarization.\",\n}\n",
