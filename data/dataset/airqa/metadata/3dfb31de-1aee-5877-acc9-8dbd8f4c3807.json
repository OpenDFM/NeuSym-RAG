In this task, we need to identify entity boundaries and category labels for the six identified categories. We use BERT embedding to represent each character in the original sentence and train CRF-Rdrop to predict named entity categories using the data set provided by the organizer. Our best submission, with a macro average F1 score of 0.5657, ranked 15th out of 22 teams.\",\n}\n",
