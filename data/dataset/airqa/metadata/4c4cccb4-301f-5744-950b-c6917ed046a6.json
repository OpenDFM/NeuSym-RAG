We deployed a framework based on different pre-trained models according to the target language for these two tasks.HITS also participated in the Relation Classification track (Task 3). The main task was recognizing the discourse relation between text spans from different languages. We designed a joint model for languages with a small corpus while separate models for large corpora.
