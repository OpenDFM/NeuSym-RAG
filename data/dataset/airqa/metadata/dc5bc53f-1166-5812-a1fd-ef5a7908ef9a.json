The course features 15 sessions, each consisting of a lecture and a practical part, and two homework assignments organized as CodaLab competitions. The first six sessions of the course are devoted to the Transformer and the variations of this architecture (e.g., encoders, decoders, encoder-decoders) as well as different techniques of model tuning. Subsequent sessions are devoted to multilingualism, multimodality (e.g., texts and images), efficiency, event sequences, and tabular data.We ran the course for different audiences: academic students and people from industry. The first run was held in 2022. During the subsequent iterations until 2024, it was constantly updated and extended with recently emerged findings on GPT-4, LLMs, RLHF, etc. Overall, it has been ran six times (four times in industry and twice in academia) and received positive feedback from academic and industry students.\",\n}\n",
