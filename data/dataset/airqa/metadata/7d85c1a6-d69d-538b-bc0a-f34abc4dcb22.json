This study tests to what extent English BERT{'}s meaning representations correspond to known constructions from the linguistics literature by means of two tasks that we propose. Firstly, by predicting the words that can be used in open slots of constructions, the meaning associations of more lexicalized constructions can be observed. Secondly, by finding similar sequences using BERT{'}s output embeddings and manually reviewing the resulting sentences, we can observe whether instances of less lexicalized constructions are clustered together in semantic space.
