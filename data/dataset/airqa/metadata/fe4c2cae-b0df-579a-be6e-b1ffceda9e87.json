Our evaluation across both open-source (e.g., Llama 2, WizardLM) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-4, PALM2, Gemini) LLMs highlights three key findings: open-source models significantly lag behind closed-source ones in format adherence; LLMs{'} format-following performance is independent of their content generation quality; and LLMs{'} format proficiency varies across different domains. These insights suggest the need for specialized tuning for format-following skills and highlight FoFo{'}s role in guiding the selection of domain-specific AI agents. FoFo will be publicly released, contributing a critical tool for advancing LLM evaluation and application.\",\n}\n",
