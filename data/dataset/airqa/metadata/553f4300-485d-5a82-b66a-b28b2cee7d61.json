Inspired by the recent chain-of-thought (CoT) idea, in this work we introduce a Three-hop Reasoning (THOR) CoT framework to mimic the human-like reasoning process for ISA. We design a three-step prompting principle for THOR to step-by-step induce the implicit aspect, opinion, and finally the sentiment polarity. Our THOR+Flan-T5 (11B) pushes the state-of-the-art (SoTA) by over 6{\\%} F1 on supervised setup. More strikingly, THOR+GPT3 (175B) boosts the SoTA by over 50{\\%} F1 on zero-shot setting.\",\n}\n",
