Constrained by data scarcity, most existing methods distill the well-trained ad-hoc retriever to the conversational retriever.

In this paper, we propose {pasted macro {`}FULLMODEL{'}} ({pasted macro {`}MODEL{'}}) which is a new post-training paradigm with three self-supervised tasks to efficiently initialize the conversational search model to enhance the dialogue structure and contextual semantic understanding. Furthermore, the {pasted macro {`}MODEL{'}} can be plugged into most of the existing conversational models to boost their performance. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we apply the conversational encoder post-trained by {pasted macro {`}MODEL{'}} on the conversational search task using two benchmark datasets: CAsT-19 and CAsT-20.Extensive experiments that our {pasted macro {`}MODEL{'}} can boost the performance of several existing conversational search methods.
