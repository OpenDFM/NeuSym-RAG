Our method achieved a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.655 on the test data, surpassing the workshop{'}s mean F1-Score of 0.519. These findings suggest that integrating weighted loss functions improves the performance of transformer models in classifying unbalanced text data, while data augmentation can improve the model{'}s ability to generalize.\",\n}\n",
