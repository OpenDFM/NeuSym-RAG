Specifically, factuality can significantly impact various benchmark characteristics especially when benchmarks are related to knowledge domain, and initial data quality plays a critical role, whereas the number of learning steps has a lesser impact.Additionally, we noted that once the language model is trained with a dataset contaminated by noise, restoring its original performance becomes exceptionally challenging, verging on irreversible.\",\n}\n",
