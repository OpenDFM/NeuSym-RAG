To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel multilingual KGC framework with language-sensitive multi-graph attention such that the missing links on all given KGs can be inferred by a universal knowledge completion model. Specifically, we first build a relational graph neural network by sharing the embeddings of aligned nodes to transfer language-independent knowledge. Meanwhile, a language-sensitive multi-graph attention (LSMGA) is proposed to deal with the information inconsistency among different KGs. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvements on the DBP-5L and E-PKG datasets.\",\n}\n",
