We obtained competitive results on both the Main test set and the Nahj al-Balagha test set, ranking 14th and 7th respectively among the participants. We also demonstrate that by incorporating our augmentation technique, the classification performance of BERT and RoBERTa is improved, resulting in an increase of up to 10.1{\\%} in their F1-score.\",\n}\n",
