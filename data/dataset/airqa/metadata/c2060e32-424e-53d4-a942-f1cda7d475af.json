We propose KnowledgeDA, a unified domain language model development service to enhance the task-specific training procedure with domain knowledge graphs. Given domain-specific task texts input, KnowledgeDA can automatically generate a domain-specific language model following three steps: (i) localize domain knowledge entities in texts via an embedding-similarity approach; (ii) generate augmented samples by retrieving replaceable domain entity pairs from two views of both knowledge graph and training data; (iii) select high-quality augmented samples for fine-tuning via confidence-based assessment. We implement a prototype of KnowledgeDA to learn language models for two domains, healthcare and software development. Experiments on domain-specific text classification and QA tasks verify the effectiveness and generalizability of KnowledgeDA.\",\n}\n",
