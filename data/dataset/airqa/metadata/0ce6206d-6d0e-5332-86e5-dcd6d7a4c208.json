State-of-the-art methods of ConvQA often struggle with inexplicit question-answer pairs. These inputs are easy for human beings to understand given a conversation history, but hard for a machine to interpret, which can degrade ConvQA performance. To address this problem, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based model, CoRnNet, which utilizes question reformulations generated by large language models (LLMs) to improve ConvQA performance. CoRnNet adopts a teacher-student architecture where a teacher model learns question representations using human writing reformulations, and a student model to mimic the teacher model{'}s output via reformulations generated by LLMs. The learned question representation is then used by a RL model to locate the correct answer in a KG. Extensive experimental results show that CoRnNet outperforms state-of-the-art ConvQA models.\",\n}\n",
