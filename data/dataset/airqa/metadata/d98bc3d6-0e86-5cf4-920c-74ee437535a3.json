The corpus creation involved manual alignment of a small part of translations with original works, fine-tuning a language model on the aligned pairs, and using the fine-tuned model to align the remaining data. Ruska Romani sentences were annotated using a morphological analyzer, with rules crafted for proper nouns and borrowings. The corpus, available in JSON and Russian National Corpus XML formats. It includes 88,742 Russian tokens and 84,635 Ruska Romani tokens, 74,291 of which were grammatically annotated. The corpus could be used for linguistic research, including comparative and diachronic studies, bilingual dictionary creation, stylometry research, and NLP/MT tool development for Ruska Romani.\",\n}\n",
