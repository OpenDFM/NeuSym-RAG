We investigate an under-studied legal domain with a case study on refugee law Canada. Searching case law for past similar cases is a key part of legal work for both lawyers and judges, the potential end-users of our prototype. While traditional named-entity recognition labels such as dates are meaningful information in law, we propose to extend existing models and retrieve a total of 19 categories of items from refugee cases. After creating a novel data set of cases, we perform information extraction based on state-of-the-art neural named-entity recognition (NER). We test different architectures including two transformer models, using contextual and non-contextual embeddings, and compare general purpose versus domain-specific pre-training. The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on legal data perform best despite their smaller size, suggesting that domain-matching had a larger effect than network architecture. We achieve a F1- score superior to 90{\\%} on five of the targeted categories and superior to 80{\\%} on an additional 4 categories.\",\n}\n",
