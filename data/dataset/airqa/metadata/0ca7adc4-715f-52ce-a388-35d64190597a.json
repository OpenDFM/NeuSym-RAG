Even though the state-of-the-art method utilizes contrastive learning to boost performance, the process of summarizing all local tokens to form a sequence representation for the whole text includes noise that may obscure limited key information. We propose Mutual Information Maximization Framework for Short Text Clustering (MIST), which overcomes the information drown-out by including a mechanism to maximize the mutual information between representations on both sequence and token levels. Experimental results across eight standard short text datasets show that MIST outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of Accuracy or Normalized Mutual Information in most cases.\",\n}\n",
