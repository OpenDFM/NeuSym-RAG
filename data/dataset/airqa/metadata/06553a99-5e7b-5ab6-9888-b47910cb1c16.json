This paper describes SemEval-2023 Task 6: LegalEval: Understanding Legal Texts, Sub-task A: Rhetorical Roles Prediction (RR). We propose a system to automatically generate rhetorical roles of all the sentences in a legal case document using Hierarchical Bi-LSTM CRF model and RoBERTa transformer. We also showcase different techniques used to manipulate dataset to generate a set of varying embeddings and train the Hierarchical Bi-LSTM CRF model to achieve better performance. Among all, model trained with the sent2vec embeddings concatenated with the handcrafted features perform better with the micro f1-score of 0.74 on test data.\",\n}\n",
