To overcome these challenges, we introduce MulQuestions, a new temporal KG reasoning benchmark featuring over 200k entities and 960k questions designed to facilitate complex, multi-relational and multi-hop reasoning. Additionally, we propose a new model adept at conducting pattern-aware and time-sensitive reasoning across temporal KGs. The model{'}s efficacy is confirmed through rigorous evaluations, showcasing its effectiveness in sparse data conditions and adeptness at handling questions with long reasoning chains.
