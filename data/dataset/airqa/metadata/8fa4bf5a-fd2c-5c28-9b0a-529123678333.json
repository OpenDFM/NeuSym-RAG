In response, we develop FreshPrompt, a few-shot prompting method that curates and organizes relevant information from a search engine into an LLM{'}s prompt. Our experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.AI. To facilitate future work, we additionally develop FreshEval, a reliable autorater for quick evaluation and comparison on FreshQA. Our latest results with FreshEval suggest that open-source LLMs such as Mixtral (Jiang et al., 2024), when combined with FreshPrompt, are competitive with closed-source and commercial systems on search-augmented QA.\",\n}\n",
