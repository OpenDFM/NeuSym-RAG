    "abstract": "This paper explores the intersection of lexical complexity prediction and lexical semantic change detection. We investigate the potential connection between changes in lexical complexity and lexical semantics, aiming to uncover how these two aspects of language evolution are intertwined. Our findings indicate that lexical complexity models human annotator uncertainty surprisingly well. Further, we find a moderate correlation between changes in lexical complexity and graded lexical semantic change. This highlights the potential for leveraging lexical complexity for lexical semantic change detection.",
