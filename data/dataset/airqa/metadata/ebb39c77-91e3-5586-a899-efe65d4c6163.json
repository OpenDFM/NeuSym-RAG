However, even when conveying external knowledge, humans integrate their own knowledge, experiences, and opinions with external knowledge to make their utterances engaging. In this study, we analyze such human behavior by annotating the utterances in an existing knowledge-grounded dialogue corpus. Each entity in the corpus is annotated with its information source, either derived from external knowledge (database-derived) or the speaker{'}s own knowledge, experiences, and opinions (speaker-derived). Our analysis shows that the presence of speaker-derived information in the utterance improves dialogue engagingness. We also confirm that responses generated by an existing model, which is trained to reflect the given knowledge, cannot include speaker-derived information in responses as often as humans do.\",\n}\n",
