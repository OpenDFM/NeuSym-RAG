The aim of this study is to create a technique for identifying the specific type of suitable spoiler - be it a phrase, a passage, or a multipart spoiler - needed to neutralize clickbait posts. This is achieved by developing a machine learning classifier analyzing both the clickbait post and the linked web page. Modern approaches for constructing a text classifier usually rely on fine-tuning a transformer-based model pre-trained on large unsupervised corpora. However, recent advances in the development of large-scale language models have led to the emergence of a new transfer learning paradigm based on prompt engineering. In this work, we study these two transfer learning techniques and compare their effectiveness for clickbait spoiler-type detection task. Our experimental results show that for this task, using the standard fine-tuning method gives better results than using prompting. The best model can achieve a similar performance to that presented by Hagen et al. (2022).\",\n}\n",
