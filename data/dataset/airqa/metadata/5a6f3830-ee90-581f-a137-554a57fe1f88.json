The emotions are experienced, targeted, and caused by different semantic constituents. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate these semantic constituents into the process of emotion detection. In this study, we propose a new task called emotion semantic parsing which aims to parse the emotion and semantic constituents into an abstract semantic tree structure. In particular, we design an end-to-end generation model to capture the relations between emotion and all the semantic constituents, and to generate them jointly. Furthermore, we employ a task decomposition strategy to capture the semantic relation among these constituents in a more cognitive and structural way. Experimental results demonstrate the importance of the proposed task, and indicate the proposed model gives superior performance compared to other models.\",\n}\n",
