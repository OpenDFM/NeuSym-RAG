We present a German medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) system capable of cross-domain knowledge transferring. The system builds on a pre-trained German language model and a token-level binary classifier, employing semantic types sourced from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) as entity labels to identify corresponding entity spans within the input text. To enhance the system{'}s performance and robustness, we pre-train it using a medical literature corpus that incorporates UMLS semantic term annotations. We evaluate the system{'}s effectiveness on two German annotated datasets obtained from different clinics in zero- and few-shot settings. The results show that our approach outperforms task-specific Condition Random Fields (CRF) classifiers in terms of accuracy.
