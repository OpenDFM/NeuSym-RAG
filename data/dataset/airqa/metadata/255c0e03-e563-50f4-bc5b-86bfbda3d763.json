Detecting these advertisements is crucial for establishing and maintaining a safer online environment for young people. In our study, we utilized Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to identify addictive substance advertisements in digital media. The performance of MLLMs depends on the quality of the prompt used to instruct the model. To optimize our prompts, an adaptive prompt engineering approach was implemented, leveraging a genetic algorithm to refine and enhance the prompts. To evaluate the model{'}s performance, we augmented the RICO dataset, consisting of Android user interface screenshots, by superimposing alcohol ads onto them. Our results indicate that the MLLM can detect advertisements promoting alcohol with a 0.94 accuracy and a 0.94 F1 score.\",\n}\n",
