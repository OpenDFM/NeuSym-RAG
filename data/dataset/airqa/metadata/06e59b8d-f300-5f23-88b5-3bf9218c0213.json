(2) The consistently increasing size and computational resources make it difficult for non-commercial and individual researchers to fine-tune and scale these language models. Major LLMs with external knowledge are also proprietary. In this paper, we propose AcKnowledge, a framework wrapped around a small, non-pre-trained language model for an open-domain question-answering (QA) experiment. AcKnowledge learns relevant knowledge from the internet via meta-learning based on user questions, and re-learns from user feedback if knowledge is misrepresented. Our efficient knowledge representation framework avoids pre-training overhead while enabling updated information. Benchmarking shows competitive performance against similarly sized state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs on gold standard QA datasets, demonstrating the potential of integrating internet search and user feedback for improved performance and generalizability.\",\n}\n",
