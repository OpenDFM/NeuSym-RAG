The challenge involves analyzing both the textual and visual components of memes to identify underlying propagandistic messages. Our approach integrates the capabilities of MARBERT and ResNet50, top-performing pre-trained models for text and image processing, respectively. Our system architecture combines these models through a fusion layer that integrates and processes the extracted features, creating a comprehensive representation that is more effective in detecting nuanced propaganda. Our proposed system achieved significant success, placing second with an F1 score of 0.7987.\",\n}\n",
