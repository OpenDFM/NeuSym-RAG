When there are multiple entity pairs that share an entity in a sentence, a QA-based relation extraction model that outputs only one single answer to a given question may not extract desired relations. In addition, these methods employ QA models that are not tuned for relation extraction. To address these issues, we first extend and apply a span QA-based relation extraction method to the drug-protein relation extraction by creating question templates and incorporating entity type markers. We further propose a binary QA-based method that directly uses the entity information available in the relation extraction task. The experimental results on the DrugProt dataset show that our QA-based methods, especially the proposed binary QA method, are effective for drug-protein relation extraction.\",\n}\n",
