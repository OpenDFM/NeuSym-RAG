We divide it into three steps of retrieval, re-ranking and generation. Our methods include negative sample augmentation, prompt learning, pseudo-labeling and ensemble. On the submission page, we rank 2nd based on the sum of token-level F1, SacreBleu and Rouge-L scores used for the final evaluation, and get the total score of 210.25.\",\n}\n",
