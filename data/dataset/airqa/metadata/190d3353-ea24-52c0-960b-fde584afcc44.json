Therefore, adapting linguistic structures within LLM training data to promote gender-inclusivity can make gender representations within the model more inclusive.The focus of our work are gender-exclusive affixes in English, such as in {`}show-girl{'} or {`}man-cave{'}, which can perpetuate gender stereotypes and binary conceptions of gender.We use an LLM training dataset to compile a catalogue of 692 gender-exclusive terms along with gender-neutral variants and from this, develop a gender-inclusive fine-tuning dataset, the {`}Tiny Heap{'}. Fine-tuning three different LLMs with this dataset, we observe an overall reduction in gender-stereotyping tendencies across the models. Our approach provides a practical method for enhancing gender inclusivity in LLM training data and contributes to incorporating queer-feminist linguistic activism in bias mitigation research in NLP.\",\n}\n",
