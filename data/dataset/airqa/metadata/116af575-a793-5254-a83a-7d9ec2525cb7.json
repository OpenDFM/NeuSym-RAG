Recently, the textual encoders of multi-modal pre-trained models have been shown to generate high-quality textual representations, which often outperform models that are purely text-based, such as BERT. In this study, our objective is to utilize both textual and visual encoders of multi-modal pre-trained models to enhance language understanding tasks. We achieve this by generating an image associated with a textual prompt, thus enriching the representation of a phrase for downstream tasks. Results from experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method, which leverages visually-enhanced text representations, significantly improves performance in the entity clustering task.\",\n}\n",
