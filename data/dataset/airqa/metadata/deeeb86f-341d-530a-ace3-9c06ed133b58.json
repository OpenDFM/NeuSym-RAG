We fine-tuned these models on the task-specific dataset, adjusting model layers and hyperparameters in an attempt to optimize performance. As we observe unstable fluctuations in performance metrics during training, we implement an ensemble approach that combines predictions from different learning epochs. Our model achieves promising results, with the best-performing configuration achieving F1 score of 93.8{\\%} on the validation set and 89.8{\\%} on the test set.\",\n}\n",
