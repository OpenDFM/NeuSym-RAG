We aim to enhance translation quality in this low-resource scenario by integrating state-of-the-art pre-trained automated speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-text machine translation (MT) models. Our cascade system incorporates a Whisper model fine-tuned for ASR and an IndicTrans2 model fine-tuned for MT. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end system that combines a Whisper model for speech-to-text conversion with knowledge distilled from an IndicTrans2 MT model. We first fine-tune the IndicTrans2 model to generate pseudo data in Indic languages. This pseudo data, along with the original English speech data, is then used to fine-tune the Whisper model. Experimental results show that the cascaded system achieved a BLEU score of 51.0, outperforming the end-to-end model, which scored 19.1 BLEU. Moreover, the analysis indicates that applying knowledge distillation from the IndicTrans2 model to the end-to-end ST model improves the translation quality by about 0.7 BLEU.\",\n}\n",
