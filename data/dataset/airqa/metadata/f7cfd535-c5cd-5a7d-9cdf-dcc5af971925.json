While this distinction is marked by a \\textit{vocative case} marker in some languages, many modern Indo-European languages such as English do not use such explicit vocative markers, and the distinction is left to be interpreted in context. In this paper, we present a new annotated dataset that captures the \\textit{address} vs. \\textit{reference} distinction in English, an automatic tagger that performs at 85{\\%} accuracy in making this distinction, and demonstrate how this distinction is important in NLP and computational social science applications in English language.\",\n}\n",
