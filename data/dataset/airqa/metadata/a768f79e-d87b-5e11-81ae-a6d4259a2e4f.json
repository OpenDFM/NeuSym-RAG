This tool provides six core functions of annotation that support the whole lifecycle of corpus generation including i)annotation project management, ii)resource management, iii)ontology management, iv)manual annotation, v)onsite auto annotation, and vi)annotation task statistic. Two experiments are carried out to verify efficiency of the presented tool. A live demo of Autodive is available at \\url{http://autodive.sciwiki.cn}.
