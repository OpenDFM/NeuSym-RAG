It primarily features a benchmark Python library for assessing global model robustness, offering high flexibility and extensibility, thereby enabling customization with user-defined noise types and models. Additionally, a GUI-based interface has been developed to intuitively analyze local model behavior. In this paper, we delineate the design principles and utilization of the created library and GUI-based web platform.
