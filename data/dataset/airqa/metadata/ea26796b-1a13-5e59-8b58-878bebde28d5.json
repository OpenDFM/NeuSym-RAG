We experiment with different settings like loss functions specific for subjective tasks and include anonymized annotator-specific information to help us understand the level of disagreement. We perform an in-depth analysis of the performance discrepancy of these different modelling choices. Our system achieves a cross-entropy of 0.58, 4.01 and 3.70 on the test sets of HS-Brexit, ArMIS and MD-Agreement, respectively. Our code implementation is publicly available.\",\n}\n",
