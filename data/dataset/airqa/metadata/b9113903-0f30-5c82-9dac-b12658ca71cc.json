Specifically, BELT provides interactive lessons on basic Python programming, coupled with projects to develop specific language technologies, such as spellcheckers or word games. In this paper, we describe BELT{'}s design, the motivation underlying many key decisions, and preliminary responses from learners.\",\n}\n",
