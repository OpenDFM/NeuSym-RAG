For the first time, we annotate the discourse and non-discourse connnective occurrences of dA in Turkish with the PDTB principles. Using a minimal set of linguistic features, we develop binary classifiers to distinguish its discourse connective usage from its other usages. We show that despite its ability to cliticize to any syntactic type, variable position in the sentence and having a wide argument span, its discourse/non-discourse connective usage can be annotated reliably and its discourse usage can be disambiguated by exploiting local cues.\",\n}\n",
