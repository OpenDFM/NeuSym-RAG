By focusing on the en-de language pair, we rely on a newly created test suite to investigate systems’ ability to correctly translate feminine and masculine gender. Our results indicate that – under realistic conditions – current ST systems achieve reasonable and comparable performance in correctly translating both feminine and masculine forms when contextual gender information is available.
