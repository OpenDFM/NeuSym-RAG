Although information extraction from SM has been well-studied, drug switches detection and reasons behind these switches from SM have not been studied yet. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new SM listening approach for analyzing online patient conversations that contain information about drug switching, drug effectiveness, side effects, and adverse drug reactions. We describe a deep learning-based approach for identifying instances of drug switching in SM posts, as well as a method for extracting the reasons behind these switches. To train and test our models, we used annotated SM data from internal dataset which is automatically created using a rule-based method. We evaluated our models using Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) and found that our SM listening approach can extract medication change information and reasons with high accuracy, achieving an F1-score of 98{\\%} and a ROUGE-1 score of 93{\\%}, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that our SM listening approach has the potential to provide valuable insights into patients{'} experiences with drug treatments, which can be used to improve patient outcomes and the effectiveness of drug treatments.\",\n}\n",
