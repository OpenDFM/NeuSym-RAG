Our approach involves leveraging a combination of a BM25-based IR model and a language model to retrieve relevant passages from a corpus. These passages are then used to train a model that utilizes a weighted average of losses. The prediction is generated by a decoder stack that includes a projection layer and conditional random field. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we participated in the English track of the MultiCoNER-II competition. Our approach yielded promising results, which we validated through detailed analysis.\",\n}\n",
