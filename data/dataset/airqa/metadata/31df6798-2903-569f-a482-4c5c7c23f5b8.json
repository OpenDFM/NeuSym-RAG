In this paper, we have presented methods that can automate the information acquisition process. We have presented a joint framework that performs information extraction and sentiment analysis to acquire demand related information from business text documents. The proposed system leverages a TwinBERT-based deep neural network model to first extract product information for which demand is associated and then identify the respective sentiment polarity. The articles are also subjected to causal analytics, that, together yield rich contextual information about reasons for rise or fall of demand of various products. The enriched information is targeted for the decision-makers, analysts and knowledge workers. We have exhaustively evaluated our proposed models with datasets curated and annotated for two different domains namely, automobile sector and housing. The proposed model outperforms the existing baseline systems.\",\n}\n",
