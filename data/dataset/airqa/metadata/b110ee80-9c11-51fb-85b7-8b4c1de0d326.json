Since proper feedback is critical to student assessment, explainability will be crucial for deploying ASAG in real-world applications. This paper proposes a framework to generate explainable outcomes for assessing question-answer pairs of a Data Mining course in a binary manner. Our framework utilizes a fine-tuned Transformer-based classifier and an explainability module using SHAP or Integrated Gradients to generate language explanations for each prediction. We assess the outcome of our framework by calculating accuracy-based metrics for classification performance. Furthermore, we evaluate the quality of the explanations by measuring their agreement with human-annotated justifications using Intersection-Over-Union at a token level to derive a plausibility score. Despite the relatively limited sample, results show that our framework derives explanations that are, to some degree, aligned with domain-expert judgment. Furthermore, both explainability methods perform similarly in their agreement with human-annotated explanations. A natural progression of our work is to analyze the use of our explainable ASAG framework on a larger sample to determine the feasibility of implementing a pilot study in a real-world setting.\",\n}\n",
