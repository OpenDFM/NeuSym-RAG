The objective was to build mod- els that can predict 11 classes of emotions, or the lack thereof (neutral class) based on code- mixed Roman Urdu and English SMS text messages. We participated in Track 2 of this task - multi-class emotion classification (MCEC). We used generative pretrained transformers, namely ChatGPT because it has a commercially available full-scale API, for the emotion detec- tion task by leveraging the prompt engineer- ing and zero-shot / few-shot learning method- ologies based on multiple experiments on the dev set. Although this was the first time we used a GPT model for the purpose, this ap- proach allowed us to beat our own baseline character-based XGBClassifier, as well as the baseline model trained by the organizers (bert- base-multilingual-cased). We ranked 4th and achieved the macro F1 score of 0.7038 and the accuracy of 0.7313 on the blind test set.\",\n}\n",
