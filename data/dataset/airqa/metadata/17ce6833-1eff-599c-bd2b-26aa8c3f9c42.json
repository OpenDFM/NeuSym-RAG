However, current methods based solely on encoders or decoders overlook the possibility that these two modules may promote each other. As a first effort to bridge this gap, we propose an autoencoder named ZeroAE. Specifically, the text is encoded with two separate BERT-based encoders into two disentangled spaces, i.e., label-relevant (for classification) and label-irrelevant respectively. The two latent spaces are then decoded by prompting GPT-2 to recover the text as well as to further generate text with labels in the unseen domains to train the encoder in turn. To better exploit the unlabeled data, a novel indirect uncertainty-aware sampling (IUAS) approach is proposed to train ZeroAE. Extensive experiments show that ZeroAE largely surpasses the SOTA methods by 15.93{\\%} and 8.70{\\%} on average respectively in the label-partially-unseen and label-fully-unseen scenario. Notably, the label-fully-unseen ZeroAE even possesses superior performance to the label-partially-unseen SOTA methods.\",\n}\n",
