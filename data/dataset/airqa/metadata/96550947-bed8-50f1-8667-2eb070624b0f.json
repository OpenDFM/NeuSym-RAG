This study seeks to enhance the performance of emotion prediction models by incorporating the Pearson correlation coefficient as a regularization term within the loss function. This regularization approach ensures closer alignment between predicted and actual emotion levels, mitigating extreme predictions and resulting in smoother and more consistent outputs. Such outputs are essential for capturing the subtle transitions between continuous emotion levels. Through experimental comparisons between models with and without Pearson regularization, our findings demonstrate that integrating the Pearson correlation coefficient significantly boosts model performance, yielding higher correlation scores and more accurate predictions.
