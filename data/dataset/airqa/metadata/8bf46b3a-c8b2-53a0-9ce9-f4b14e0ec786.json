In this work, we propose BOLT, which relies on tunable biases to directly adjust the language model{'}s output logits. Unlike prior work, BOLT maintains the generator{'}s autoregressive nature to assert a strong control on token-wise conditional dependencies and overall fluency, and thus converges faster. When compared with state-of-the-arts on controlled generation tasks using both soft constraints (e.g., sentiment control) and hard constraints (e.g., keyword-guided topic control), BOLT demonstrates significantly improved efficiency and fluency. On sentiment control, BOLT is 7x faster than competitive baselines, and more fluent in 74.4{\\%} of the evaluation samples according to human judges.\",\n}\n",
