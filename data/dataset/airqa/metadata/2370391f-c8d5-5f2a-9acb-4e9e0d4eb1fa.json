Current methods typically activate the cross-lingual transferability of multilingual Transformers by fine-tuning them on end-task data. However, the methods cannot perform cross-lingual transfer when end-task data are unavailable. In this work, we explore whether the cross-lingual transferability can be activated without end-task data. We propose a cross-lingual transfer method, named PlugIn-X. PlugIn-X disassembles monolingual and multilingual Transformers into sub-modules, and reassembles them to be the multilingual end-task model. After representation adaptation, PlugIn-X finally performs cross-lingual transfer in a plug-and-play style. Experimental results show that PlugIn-X successfully activates the cross-lingual transferability of multilingual Transformers without accessing end-task data. Moreover, we analyze how the cross-model representation alignment affects the cross-lingual transferability.\",\n}\n",
