We measure the ability of several masked language models and encoder-decoder models. The results show that while large language models can use prepositions such as {``}in{''} and {``}into{''} in the provided context to infer size relationships, they fail to use verbs and thus make incorrect judgments led by their prior physical commonsense.\",\n}\n",
