Thus the level of intimacy can provide us with deeper insights and richer semantics of conversations. In this paper, we present our work on the SemEval shared task 9 on predicting the level of intimacy for the given text. The dataset consists of tweets in ten languages, out of which only six are available in the training dataset. We conduct several experiments and show that an ensemble of multilingual models along with a language-specific monolingual model has the best performance. We also evaluate other data augmentation methods such as translation and present the results. Lastly, we study the results thoroughly and present some noteworthy insights into this problem.\",\n}\n",
