Therefore, using methods from the causal inference literature, we propose an algorithm to regularize the learnt effect of the features on the model{'}s prediction to the estimated effect of feature on label. This results in an automated augmentation method that leverages the estimated effect of a feature to appropriately change the labels for new augmented inputs.
