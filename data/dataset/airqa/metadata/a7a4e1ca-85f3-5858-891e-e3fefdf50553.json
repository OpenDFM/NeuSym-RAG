The functionalities of the evaluation tool include summaries of benchmarks for over 2,300 models covering 4,560 language directions and 294 languages, as well as the inspection of predicted translations against their human reference. We focus on centralization, reproducibility and coverage of MT evaluation combined with scalability. The dashboard can be accessed live at \\url{https://opus.nlpl.eu/dashboard/}.\",\n}\n",
