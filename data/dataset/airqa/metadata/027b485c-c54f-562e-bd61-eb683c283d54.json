In our system, we use speech recognition tasks to pre-train encoder parameters, and then use speech translation corpus to train the multilingual speech translation model. We have also adopted other methods to optimize the model, such as data augmentation, model ensemble, etc. Our system can obtain satisfactory results on test sets of 10 languages in the MUST-C corpus.\",\n}\n",
