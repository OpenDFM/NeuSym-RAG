While existing works focus on developing sophisticated claim verification modules, the fundamental importance of evidence retrieval is largely ignored. Existing approaches usually adopt the heuristic semantic similarity-based retrieval strategy, resulting in the task-irrelevant evidence and undesirable performance. In this paper, we concentrate on evidence retrieval and propose a Retrieval-Augmented Verification framework RAV, consisting of two major modules: the hybrid evidence retrieval and the joint fact verification. Hybrid evidence retrieval module incorporates an efficient retriever for preliminary pruning of candidate evidence, succeeded by a ranker that generates more precise sorting results. Under this end-to-end training paradigm, gradients from the claim verification can be back-propagated to enhance evidence selection. Experimental results on FEVER dataset demonstrate the superiority of RAV.\",\n}\n",
