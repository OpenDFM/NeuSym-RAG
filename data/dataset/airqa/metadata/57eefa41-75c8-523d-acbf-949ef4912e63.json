To ensure quality, we used semantic similarity, perplexity, and lexical diversity as evaluation metrics. Combining supervised contrastive learning and cross-entropy-based learning, our best model, incorporating R-drop and various LM generation-based augmentations, achieved an impressive F1 score of 0.9230 on the test set, surpassing the task mean and median scores.\",\n}\n",
