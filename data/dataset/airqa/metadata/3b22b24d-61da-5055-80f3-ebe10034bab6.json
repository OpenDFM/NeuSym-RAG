The VWSD task is to identify the correct image that corresponds to an ambiguous target word given limited textual context. To reduce word ambiguity and enhance image selection, we proposed several text augmentation techniques, such as prompting, WordNet synonyms, and text generation. We experimented with different vision-language pre-trained models to capture the joint features of the augmented text and image. Our approach achieved the best performance using a combination of GPT-3 text generation and the CLIP model. On the multilingual test sets, our system achieved an average hit rate (at top-1) of 51.11 and a mean reciprocal rank of 65.69.\",\n}\n",
