A two-stage fine-tuning approach was introduced for utilizing knowledge learnt from different datasets. We evaluated the performance of our method using a variety of metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, bertscore, CheXbert, and RadGraph. Our results revealed the potentials of different models in summarizing radiology reports and demonstrated the effectiveness of the two-stage fine-tuning approach. We also discussed the limitations and future directions of our work, highlighting the need for better understanding the architecture design{'}s effect and optimal way of fine-tuning accordingly in automatic clinical summarizations.\",\n}\n",
