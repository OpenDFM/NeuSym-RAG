As a result, the existing annotation tools perform poorly. We compiled three data sets for the development of an automatic annotation tool and carried out an inter-annotator agreement study, with a promising agreement score. The experimental results show that our part-of-speech tagger yields accuracy scores that are almost 50 percentage points higher than the widely used rule-based system Morpheus. In addition, error analysis revealed problems related to phenomena also occurring in current social media language.\",\n}\n",
