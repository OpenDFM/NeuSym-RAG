We participated as NITS{\\_}Legal team in Task A and conducted exploratory experiments to improve our understanding of the task. Our results suggest that sequence context is crucial in performing rhetorical roles prediction. Given the lengthy nature of legal documents, we propose a BiLSTM-based sentence sequence labeling approach that uses a local context-incorporated dataset created from the original dataset. To better represent the sentences during training, we extract legal domain-specific sentence embeddings from a Legal BERT model. Our experimental findings emphasize the importance of considering local context instead of treating each sentence independently to achieve better performance in this task.
