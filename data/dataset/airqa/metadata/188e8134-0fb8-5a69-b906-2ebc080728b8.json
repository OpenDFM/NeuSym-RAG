In this paper we present the approach developed by the SINAI team as the result of our participation in BioLaySumm shared task hosted by the BioNLP workshop at ACL 2024. Our approach stems from the experimentation we performed in order to test the ability of state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models, namely GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and Llama-3, to tackle this task in a few-shot manner. In order to improve this baseline, we opted for fine-tuning Llama-3 by applying parameter-efficient methodologies.
