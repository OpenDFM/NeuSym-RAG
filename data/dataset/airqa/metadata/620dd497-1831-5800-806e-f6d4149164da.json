Particularly, the anisotropy of such representations has been observed, which means that the directions of the word vectors are not evenly distributed across the space but rather concentrated in a narrow cone. This has led to several attempts to counteract this phenomenon both on static and contextualized text representations. However, despite this effort, there is no established relationship between anisotropy and performance. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the impact of different transformations on both the isotropy and the performance in order to assess the true impact of anisotropy. To this end, we rely on the clustering task as a means of evaluating the ability of text representations to produce meaningful groups. Thereby, we empirically show a limited impact of anisotropy on the expressiveness of sentence representations both in terms of directions and L2 closeness.\",\n}\n",
