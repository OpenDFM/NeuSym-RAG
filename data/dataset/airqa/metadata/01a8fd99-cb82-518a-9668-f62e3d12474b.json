To overcome these limitations, we present {``}Echoes from Alexandria{''}, or in shortened form, {``}Echoes{''}, a large resource for multilingual book summarization. Echoes featuresthree novel datasets: i) Echo-Wiki, for multilingual book summarization, ii) Echo-XSum, for extremely-compressive multilingual book summarization, and iii) Echo-FairySum, for extractive book summarization. To the best of our knowledge, Echoes {--} with its thousands of books and summaries {--} is the largest resource, and the first to be multilingual, featuring 5 languages and 25 language pairs. In addition to Echoes, we also introduce a new extractive-then-abstractive baseline, and, supported by our experimental results and manual analysis of the summaries generated, we argue that this baseline is more suitable for book summarization than purely-abstractive approaches. We release our resource and software at \\url{https://github.com/Babelscape/echoes-from-alexandria} in the hope of fostering innovative research in multilingual booksummarization.\",\n}\n",
