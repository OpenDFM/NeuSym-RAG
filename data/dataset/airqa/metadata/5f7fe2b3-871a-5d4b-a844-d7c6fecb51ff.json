However, current generation models often fail to effectively utilize rich linguistic and world knowledge to generate conversations just like human. In this work, we introduce a novel conversation generation framework to effectively incorporate human knowledge and conversation structures with both controllability and interpretability for better conversation generation. Specifically, we first generate the prototype conversations from short descriptions. We then gradually and strategically incorporate different levels of conversation structures including the action triples, dialogue acts and discourse relations via diffusion models to directly edit the prototype conversations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on two datasets by comparing our method with the state-of-the-art baseline models.\",\n}\n",
