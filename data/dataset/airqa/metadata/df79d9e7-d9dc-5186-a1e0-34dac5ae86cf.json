This paper proposes an approach utilizing frame knowledge as conceptual semantic guidance to bridge the gap between known intents representation learning and unknown intents clustering. Specifically, we employ semantic regularization to minimize the bidirectional KL divergence between model predictions for frame-based and sentence-based samples. Moreover, we construct a frame-guided data augmenter to capture intent-friendly semantic information and implement contrastive clustering learning for unsupervised sentence embedding. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves substantial improvements in accuracy (5{\\%}+) compared to solid baselines.\",\n}\n",
