There are two subtasks: generation and verification. In generation, models continue statements like {``}The penultimate word in this sentence is{''} (where a correct continuation is {``}is{''}). In verification, models judge the truth of statements like {``}The penultimate word in this sentence is sentence.{''} (false). We also provide minimally different metalinguistic non-self-reference examples to complement the main dataset by probing for whether models can handle metalinguistic language at all. The dataset is hand-crafted by experts and validated by non-expert annotators. We test a variety of open-source LLMs (7B to 70B parameters) as well as closed-source LLMs through APIs. All models perform close to chance across both subtasks and even on the non-self-referential metalinguistic control data, though we find some steady improvement with model scale. GPT 4 is the only model to consistently do significantly better than chance, and it is still only in the 60{\\%} range, while our untrained human annotators score well in the 89-93{\\%} range.
