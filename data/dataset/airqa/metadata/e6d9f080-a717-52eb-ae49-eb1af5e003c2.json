We have engaged in all four language directions and both the SimulS2T and SimulS2S tracks: English-German (EN-DE), English-Chinese (EN-ZH), English-Japanese (EN-JA), and Czech-English (CS-EN). For the S2T track, we have built upon our previous year{'}s system and further honed the cascade system composed of ASR model and MT model. Concurrently, we have introduced an end-to-end system specifically for the CS-EN direction. This end-to-end (E2E) system primarily employs the pre-trained seamlessM4T model. In relation to the SimulS2S track, we have integrated a novel TTS model into our SimulS2T system. The final submission for the S2T directions of EN-DE, EN-ZH, and EN-JA has been refined over our championship system from last year. Building upon this foundation, the incorporation of the new TTS into our SimulS2S system has resulted in the ASR-BLEU surpassing last year{'}s best score.\",\n}\n",
