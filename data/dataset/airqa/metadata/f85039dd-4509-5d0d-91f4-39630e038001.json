PRED covers annotations for various entities and relations involved in PK parameter measurements from 3,600 sentences. We also introduce an end-to-end relation extraction model based on BioBERT, which is trained with joint named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction objectives.

This work represents the first resource for training and evaluating models for PK end-to-end extraction across multiple parameters and study types. We make our corpus and model openly available to accelerate the construction of large PK databases and to support similar endeavours in other scientific disciplines.\",\n}\n",
