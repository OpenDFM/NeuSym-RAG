The main challenge is to perform argument retrieval considering socio-cultural aspects such as political interests, occupation, age, and gender. To address the challenge, we apply open-access Large Language Models (Mistral-7b) in a zero-shot fashion for re-ranking and explicit similarity scoring. Additionally, we combine different features in an ensemble setup using logistic regression. Our system ranks second in the competition for all test set rounds on average for the logistic regression approach using LLM similarity scores as a feature. In addition to the description of the approach, we also provide further results of our ablation study. Our code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.},\n}\n",
