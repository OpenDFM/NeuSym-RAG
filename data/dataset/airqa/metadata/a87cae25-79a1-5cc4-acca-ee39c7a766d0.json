Explainable AI (XAI) might provide the answer. We examine which information in text and structured data influences the performance of models in the context of multimodal decision support for biomedical tasks. Using data from an intensive care unit and targeting a mortality prediction task, we compare information that has been considered relevant by XAI methods to the opinion of a physician.\",\n}\n",
