This paper introduces a novel hierarchy-aware loss function for unit-based HTC models: Hierarchy-aware Biased Bound Margin (HBM) loss. HBM integrates learnable bounds, biases, and a margin to address static thresholding and mitigate label imbalance adaptively. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HBM compared to competitive HTC models.\",\n}\n",
