Interestingly, contrary to the expectation that LLMs would perform better when tasks are divided, we find that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-2-Chat-70B and GPT-4, show up to 7.3{\\%} and 12.4{\\%} improved performance with Multi-Task Inference compared to Single-Task Inference on the MTI Bench.
