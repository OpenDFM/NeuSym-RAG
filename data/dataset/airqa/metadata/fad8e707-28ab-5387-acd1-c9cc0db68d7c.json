In this work, we investigate the feasibility of the summarization task by finding the origin, or data provenance, of the discharge summary{'}s source text. As a motivation to understanding the data challenges of the summarization task, we present DSProv, a new dataset of 51 hospital admissions annotated by clinical informatics physicians. The dataset is analyzed for semantics and the extent of copied text from human authored electronic health record (EHR) notes. We also present a novel unsupervised method of matching notes used in discharge summaries, and release our annotation dataset1 and source code to the community.\",\n}\n",
