MultiLegalPile includes diverse legal data sources and allows for pretraining NLP models under fair use, with most of the dataset licensed very permissively. We pretrain two RoBERTa models and one Longformer multilingually, and 24 monolingual models on each of the language-specific subsets and evaluate them on LEXTREME. Additionally, we evaluate the English and multilingual models on LexGLUE. Our multilingual models set a new SotA on LEXTREME and our English models on LexGLUE. We release the dataset, trained models, and all code under the most open licenses possible.\",\n}\n",
