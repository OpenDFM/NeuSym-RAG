We study the robustness of MRC models to names which is flexible and repeatability. MRC models based on LMs may overuse the name information to make predictions, which causes the representation of names to be non-interchangeable, called name bias. In this paper, we propose a novel Causal Interventional paradigm for MRC (CI4MRC) to mitigate name bias. Specifically, we uncover that the pre-trained knowledge concerning names is indeed a confounder by analyzing the causalities among the pre-trained knowledge, context representation and answers based on a Structural Causal Model (SCM). We develop effective CI4MRC algorithmic implementations to constrain the confounder based on the neuron-wise and token-wise adjustments. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed CI4MRC effectively mitigates the name bias and achieves competitive performance on the original SQuAD. Moreover, our method is general to various pre-trained LMs and performs robustly on the adversarial datasets.\",\n}\n",
