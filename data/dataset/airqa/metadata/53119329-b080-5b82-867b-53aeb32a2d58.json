Stance detection, which identifies the viewpoint expressed in text toward a target, has predominantly focused on English. MAWQIF is the pioneering Arabic dataset for target-specific stance detection, consisting of 4,121 tweets annotated with stance, sentiment, and sarcasm. The original dataset, benchmarked on four BERT-based models, achieved a best macro-F1 score of 78.89, indicating significant room for improvement. This study evaluates the effectiveness of three Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting target-specific stances in MAWQIF. The LLMs assessed are ChatGPT-3.5-turbo, Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon-7B-Instruct. Performance was measured using both zero-shot and full fine-tuning approaches. Our findings demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances the stance detection capabilities of LLMs in Arabic tweets. Notably, GPT-3.5-Turbo achieved the highest performance with a macro-F1 score of 82.93, underscoring the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for language-specific applications.\",\n}\n",
