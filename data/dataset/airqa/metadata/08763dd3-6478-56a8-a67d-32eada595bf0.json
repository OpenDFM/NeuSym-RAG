We show that the alephBERT-based system outperforms a strong CNN-based baseline, and that it general-izes unexpectedly well in a zero-shot paradigm to items on an unseen topic that address the same underlying biological concepts, opening up the possibility of automatically assessing new items without item-specific fine-tuning.\",\n}\n",
