Our team employed a multi-faceted approach to ensure high accuracy in data annotations. Our results highlight key challenges in detecting bias and propaganda, such as the need for more comprehensive guidelines. Our team ranked first in all tracks for propaganda annotation. For Bias, the team stood in first place for the Guidelines and IAA tracks, and in second place for the Quantity and Consistency tracks.\",\n}\n",
