Human value detection requires multi-label classification since each argument maycontain multiple values. In this paper, we pro-pose an architecture called Label Graph Trans-former (LG-Transformer). LG-Transformeris a two-stage pipeline consisting of a trans-former jointly encoding argument and labelsand a graph module encoding and obtainingfurther interactions between labels. Using ad-versarial training, we can boost performanceeven further. Our best method scored 50.00 us-ing F1 score on the test set, which is 7.8 higherthan the best baseline method.
