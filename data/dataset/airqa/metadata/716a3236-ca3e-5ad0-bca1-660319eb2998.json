We introduce a new approach for exact reward computation in every possible world state by annotating all statements with executable Python programs. Each statement is paired with multiple start states and reward functions to form thousands of distinct Markov Decision Processes of varying difficulty. We experiment with lilGym with different models and learning regimes. Our results and analysis show that while existing methods are able to achieve non-trivial performance, lilGym forms a challenging open problem. lilGym is available at \\url{https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/lilgym/}.\",\n}\n",
