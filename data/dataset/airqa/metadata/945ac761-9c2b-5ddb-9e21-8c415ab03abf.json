To evaluate our approach, we participated in the SemEval 2023 shared task on {``}Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Visual-WSD){''} using a zero-shot learning setting, where we compared the accuracy of different combinations of tools, including {``}Simple prompt-based{''} methods and {``}Generated prompt-based{''} methods for prompt engineering using completion models, and text-to-image models for changing input modality from text to image. Moreover, we explored the benefits of cross-modality evaluation between text and candidate images using CLIP. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach reaches better results than cross-modality approaches, highlighting the potential of prompt engineering and text-to-image models to improve accuracy in Visual-WSD tasks.
