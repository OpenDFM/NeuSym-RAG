To fill this gap, we present $ToolSword$, a comprehensive framework dedicated to meticulously investigating safety issues linked to LLMs in tool learning. Specifically, ToolSword delineates six safety scenarios for LLMs in tool learning, encompassing $malicious$ $queries$ and $jailbreak$ $attacks$ in the input stage, $noisy$ $misdirection$ and $risky$ $cues$ in the execution stage, and $harmful$ $feedback$ and $error$ $conflicts$ in the output stage. Experiments conducted on 11 open-source and closed-source LLMs reveal enduring safety challenges in tool learning, such as handling harmful queries, employing risky tools, and delivering detrimental feedback, which even GPT-4 is susceptible to. Moreover, we conduct further studies with the aim of fostering research on tool learning safety. The data will be released upon acceptance of the paper.\",\n}\n",
