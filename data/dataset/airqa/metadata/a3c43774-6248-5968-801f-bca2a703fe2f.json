We explored various unimodal transformer models for Arabic language processing (subtask 2A), visual models for image processing (subtask 2B), and concatenated text and image embeddings using the Multilayer Perceptron fusion module for multimodal propagandistic memes classification (subtask 2C). Our system achieved 77.96{\\%} for subtask 2A, 71.04{\\%} for subtask 2B, and 79.80{\\%} for subtask 2C, ranking 2nd, 1st, and 3rd on the leaderboard.\",\n}\n",
