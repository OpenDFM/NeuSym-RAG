Although recent embedding-based entity alignment methods have shown significant advancements, they still struggle to fully utilize KG structural information. In this paper, we introduce FGWEA, an unsupervised entity alignment framework that leverages the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distance, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of entity semantics and KG structures within a joint optimization framework. To address the computational challenges associated with optimizing FGW, we devise a three-stage progressive optimization algorithm. It starts with a basic semantic embedding matching, proceeds to approximate cross-KG structural and relational similarity matching based on iterative updates of high-confidence entity links, and ultimately culminates in a global structural comparison between KGs. We perform extensive experiments on four entity alignment datasets covering 14 distinct KGs across five languages. Without any supervision or hyper-parameter tuning, FGWEA surpasses 21 competitive baselines, including cutting-edge supervised entity alignment methods.
