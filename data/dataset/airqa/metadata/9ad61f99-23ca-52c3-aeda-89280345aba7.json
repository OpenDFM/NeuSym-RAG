In this paper, we conduct an empirical exploration on the effect of each component in cross-lingual prompting and derive Universal Prompting, which helps alleviate the discrepancies between source-language training and target-language inference. Based on this, we propose DPA, a dual prompt augmentation framework, aiming at relieving the data scarcity issue in few-shot cross-lingual prompting. Notably, for XNLI, our method achieves 46.54{\\%} with only 16 English training examples per class, significantly better than 34.99{\\%} of fine-tuning.
