More precisely, when $h(t)=t$ and costs are one $b_k=1$ the authors have ES. As discussed by [1], in subsampling schemes or in compression schemes, the authors have assumption 4 with $h(t)=t$. It is important to emphasize that for instance the appearance of $h(t)=t$ in these schemes is a result of an additional smoothness assumption on the subsampled functions (Assumption 3 in [NR21]).  In general, it is true that most common applications satisfy ES with h(t)=t, but this by no means would limit the proposed contribution. It is noteworthy that the proposed framework allows the researcher from different fields to handle a wider set of non-convex functions and stochastic oracles.\n\nRegarding applications with $1<\\alpha<2$, the authors have not yet seen any real world application.

The algorithm selects the matching pair iteratively until the set of candidates becomes empty. The complexity of the algorithm is o(M^3), where M is the length of the target sentence. The authors chose this algorithm because it is easier to perform parallel computations in training.

For implementation reasons, the two approaches are not guaranteed to be equivalent: for example, duplicating the data that each actor adds increases the computational load on the replay server, whereas using a smaller memory size does not. During development the authors noticed that in very extreme cases, many actors adding large volumes of data to the replay memory could overwhelm it, causing a slowdown in sampling which would affect the performance of the learner and thus the overall results.\n \nIn the proposed experiments in Appendix A where the authors sought to determine whether recency of data was the reason for the proposed observed scalability results, the authors wanted to make certain that the load on the replay server in the duplicated-data experiments would be the same as in the experiments with the corresponding numbers of real actors, to ensure a fair comparison. In practice, the authors did not find that the authors were running into any such contention issues in these experiments, and the results from Figure 5 do agree with those in Appendix A.

The counter-example further illustrates such an advantage. In the counterexample, GenTD is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth value function with 0 error, while GTD suffers from very large bias error. The reason is that, when the function approximation class is complete (which is the setting of the proposed counterexample), learning density ratio using GenDICE (as in GenTD) does not have bias error, and the optimization error can be guaranteed to be arbitrarily small due to the convergence guarantee in [1]. With this accurately learned density ratio, GenTD can correct the distribution mismatch completely and converge to the ground true value function (as the authors establish in Theorem 1 in this paper). In contrast, GTD does not correct the distribution mismatch even with complete function approximation class (due to the nature of its design), thus still suffering from large bias error even when the function approximation class is complete."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For both cases, however, the accessibility of the embeddings are always necessary when **applying the linear probes**, which could be infeasible in practice. For example, let’s consider a black-box NLP model whose parameters and architecture are transparent to users and only the output can be provided for a given input. The linear projection could not be applied due to the lack of access to embeddings. By contrast, fairness reprogramming still works as it only appends the trigger into the input sentences to re-purpose the model. Besides, back to the original question, the authors agree that the proposed reprogramming method is equivalent to adding a linear transformation directly to the inputs in some simple cases like tabular data. The authors conducted additional experiments on the UCI Adult dataset with a two-layer MLP. An additive trigger is added to the original inputs with the input dimension unchanged, *i.e.*, $\\tilde{x}=m \\circ x+\\delta$, where $m$ is a multi-dimensional binary mask and $\\delta$ is the trigger. The **[results](https://ibb.co/ssNyK7v)** show that the proposed method is comparable with the post-processing adversarial training baseline, which empirically demonstrates the equivalence. The authors believe such a discussion may provide a very valuable insight on how the proposed method works beyond the proposed conceptual proof in Section 3.4.

As you may see, MFwoCA achieves better PPL than MT when length is 1024, which demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-grained attention. That the PPLs are so different is because of the training setting (line 224-227): MT uses a full attention and cannot process a long sequence at once, so following its paper, the authors chunked the sequences during training. When the length increases, the PPL of MT increases drastically. It indicates that the model trained on short music sequences cannot well generalize to long sequences (line 246-250). In addition, the proposed ablation study shows that both the coarse-grained attention and the bar selection benefit the overall performance, so the authors cannot say bar summary is more fundamental."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

If the authors shift it by dx, the shifted image patch J(x) = I(x - dx) = sum_k c_k e^{-i<\\omega_k, dx>} e^{i<\\omega_k, x>}. The change from the complex number c_k to c_k e^{-i<\\omega_k, dx>} corresponds to rotating a 2D vector by a 2 x 2 matrix. This is a simple example that the shift can be represented by a linear transformation in the frequency domain, as a change in phase. The proposed model does not assume Fourier basis or its localized version such as Gabor filters. The proposed model figures it out with generic vector and matrix representations. The paper assume that the motion is smooth, so that within a relative small local patch, the motion is constant. Of course, the patch size or the filter size should be related to image resolution. For images with higher resolution, the authors may want to use smaller filter size to make this assumption hold. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

From the theoretical perspective, preventing the policy from going into highly uncertain regions can reduce the accumulative model error, and thus guarantee a tighter performance lower bound and better policy improvement according to Theorem 1.

This is actually expected, i.e., the model error tends to increase when the number of samples increases. The experiments in the paper also shows consistent behavior, i.e., Fig. 8(a) in Appendix D shows that (in the case of finite $p\\_1$ and $p\\_2$) the noise effect increases when the number of samples increases. An intuitive explanation is that the overfitted solution needs to completely fit the noise component of all training samples, and thus more data also means more noise to fit (and thus contributes to larger model error). The authors discuss the relationship between the noise effect and the parameters $p\\_1$, $p\\_2$ and $n$ (along with additional simulation results) in Appendix D (due to the page limit of main text). On the other hand, the proposed current forms of terms D and E may still have room to be tightened, as the authors discussed in Appendix D, Line 560-564: \"the authors notice that Term E increases with $n$ at a speed faster than $\\sqrt{n}$. However, since it is only an upper bound, the actual noise effect may grow much slower than $\\sqrt{n}$.

A2 (Text Encoding), the authors first generate dense video descriptions using BMT [1] by sampling frames from the input video at 2 fps. For a 2-3 min video BMT generates ~10-15 sentences. Next, the authors uniformly sample 7 sentences from the dense description corresponding to different video segments over time. Each sentence is then encoded using CLIP text encoder and the 7 embeddings are concatenated to obtain a feature vector. This is passed through a linear layer to obtain the input text embedding. Heuristically, the authors found that sampling 7 captions worked best for TVSum and SumMe datasets where the average duration of the videos is ~2 mins. For generic summarization on the QFVS dataset (day long videos) reported above, the frames are extracted at 2 FPS and pass this through the BMT pipeline. This generates roughly 20 sentences and the authors then sampled 15 captions for each video since the videos are significantly longer. The authors will include these details in the final version.

There is an emerging nation-wide interest in conducting neuroimaging studies for investigating the connection between the biology of the brain, and demographic variables and clinical outcomes such as mental disorders. Such studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for cross-cutting investigations that may offer new insights to the differences in brain function and organization across subpopulations in the society (such as biological sex and age groups) as well as reveal neurophysiological mechanisms underlying brain disorders (such as psychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative diseases). These studies have a tremendous impact in social studies and biomedical sciences.  For example, mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the USA and roughly 1 in 17 have a seriously debilitating mental illness. To address this burden, national institutions such as NIH have included brain-behavior research as one of their strategic objectives and stated that sound efforts must be made to redefine mental disorders into dimensions or components of observable behaviors that are more closely aligned with the biology of the brain. Using brain imaging data to predict diagnosis has great potential to result in mechanisms that target for more effective preemption and treatment."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

On the other hand, on the larger Tiny ImageNet dataset, the gain is 0. Why the method performs worse on All-to-all attack than all-to-one attack?", "reference_answer": "A: Please note that the main contribution of this paper is to extend the concept of imperceptible backdoor from the input space to the latent representation, which significantly improves the effectiveness against the existing defense mechanisms (as the authors described in L9-11 in the Abstract). The very recent work WaNet (ICLR'21) achieved much better input-space imperceptibility than prior works, which is also the reason the authors consider WaNet as state-of-the-art in this direction of research and compare the proposed performance to it. Compared to WaNet, WB achieves as good as, if not better, than WaNet from the aspects of attack success rate  (Tables 1 and 2)  and stealthiness at the input space (Table 8 in the supplementary material). However, from the latent space, WB is much more stealthy than prior works such that the proposed method can bypass the representative defenses used for analyzing the latent space, as the authors demonstrated in Section 5.3.  \nThe reason that the authors evaluated these datasets, including the larger TinyImageNet, is to follow the similar setups and network architectures as in previous backdoor attack and defense papers for a fair comparison to the earlier methods.\nThe objective of an all-to-one attack is to manipulate all the images in the dataset to one target label. In contrast, an all-to-all attack attempts to change the labels of images at the class level (i.e., images from different original classes will have different target labels).  One common setup for all-to-all attacks is to define the target label as one-shifted (e.g., for MNIST, the target label for digit \"0\" with the backdoor is 1, the target label for digit \"1\" with the backdoor is 2, the target label for digit \"2\" with the backdoor is 3, etc.), which is used in the proposed experiments as described in Section 5.2. Thus, compared to all-to-one attacks that only have a single target label, all-to-all attacks involve multiple target labels and each target label associates to less number of poisoned images correspondingly, making such all-to-all attacks more challenging. The trend where the attack performance is worse on all-to-all attacks than all-to-one attacks is also consistent with the existing works, including BadNets and WaNet."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

ScaledGD, with the sparsification operator, cannot achieve similar initialization through hand-tuned parameters.  \n\nThe thresholding operator (in LRPCA) has two advantages over the sparsification operator (in ScaledGD): speed and no false-positives (which leads to better robustness). The speed advantage is obvious as the sparsification operator requires partial sorting in every row and every column. For robustness advantage, the authors will use an example. Recall that ScaledGD takes off the largest $\\gamma \\alpha$ fraction entries per row and per column via the sparsification operator. Let’s take the parameter $\\gamma = 1.5$ for now ($\\gamma$ must be strictly greater than $1$, and ScaledGD uses $\\gamma=2$ for analysis). When the authors have only 10% outliers, the sparsification operator takes off 15% entries---not too bad.  If the authors have 40% outliers,  the sparsification operator takes off 60% entries---lose too many good entries. In contrast, the thresholding operator (with a properly chosen thresholding value) in LRPCA takes off no more than 40% entries, and all good entries are saved. In this sense, LRPCA preserves more good redundant information than ScaledGD, especially when more outliers appear. Hence,  it is not a surprise that LRPCA outperforms ScaledGD when $\\alpha$ is larger. **The authors are happy to add a remark in the camera-ready version to clarify any ambiguity in this matter.**  \n\nIn addition, the authors add the following experiment to support the proposed claim:  \n\n*The authors generate 10 problems for each of the outlier levels (i.e., $\\alpha$) and compare"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In what applications is such condition met?", "reference_answer": "A: The goal here is to bring clearer explanations on the effect of this new regularization on the OT problem and contributions of this paper are mostly theoretical ones. The authors also want to recall that the goal of such regularization is not to approximate the true OT cost from samples, which is a non-solvable problem in high dimension but rather, as the entropic approach, to obtain a meaningful quantity able to compare distributions in the finite sample regime, even in high dimensions. Indeed recall that when $r=1$, DLOT is exactly the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (which is already a widely used metric in ML) and increasing $r$ allows to capture sharper information about the geometry of the problem instead of considering the “flat” geometry induced by the MMD. The higher the rank is, the more information about the geometry of the problem one gets, yet, at the same time, the more degraded estimation becomes as a result. Therefore, the rank $r$ introduces (much like $\\varepsilon$ in entropic OT) a tradeoff, and given a certain precision $\\delta$ and a number of samples $n$, the choice of the rank $r$ should be chosen the largest possible such that $\\sqrt{r/n}\\leq \\delta$.\nNote that when the data admits a low-rank structure (meaning that the ground cost matrix is low-rank), then it seems empirically that one does not need to choose a rank higher than this intrinsic dimension of the data. In addition, low-rank cost matrices may appears in various setting, especially when data are supported on a low-dimensional manifold with $d \\ll n$ where $d$ is the dimension of the manifold and $n$ is the number of samples. A classical illustration of this situation is when the cost considered in the squared Euclidean distance on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the authors have an exact low-rank factorization assuming that $d\\ll n$."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

At minimum, this is the case for divide-and-conquer algorithms, a category to which branch-and-bound belongs, so the authors would expect it to be a good fit for modelling any problem where the objective is to control some aspect of this larger class of algorithms.\nFor example, one could imagine a robotics problem where a rover must explore interconnected rooms to perform some action, and must explore as efficiently as possible. The control task of learning to decide which rooms to explore could be modelled as a tree MDP. Another, more abstract example could be choosing the pivot elements in quicksort, a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm. At each time step of this algorithm, the pivot is used to partition the set of elements into two, and careful selection of the pivot can have a dramatic impact on the algorithm efficiency. This is another problem that would be a good fit for a tree MDP.\nThese are only two examples, but the authors believe that the framework could be useful for many more.

However, due to the differences in the loss function and the output dimensions, the exact constructions of local minima are substantially different. Meanwhile, the Stages (2) and (3) of this paper employ the transformation operation to force the data flow to go through the same series of the linear parts of the activations. The operations are carefully designed and the whole construction is novel and non-trivial. The difficulties in extending the loss function and output dimension are justified below:\n1. From squared loss to arbitrary differentiable loss: Yun et al. (2019b) calculate the analytic formations of derivatives of the loss to construct the local minima and then prove they are spurious. This technique cannot be transplanted to the case of arbitrary differentiable loss functions, because the authors cannot assume the analytic formation. To prove that the loss surface under an arbitrary differentiable loss has an infinite number of spurious local minima, the authors employ a new proof technique based on Taylor series and a new separation lemma (see Appendix A.5, Lemma 6, p. 31) to avoid the use of the analytic formulations (see a detailed proof in Appendix A.2, Step (b), pp.14-15).\n2.  From one-dimensional output to arbitrary-dimensional output: To prove the loss surface of a neural network with an arbitrary-dimensional output has an infinite number of spurious local minima, the authors need to deal with the calculus of functions whose domain and codomain are a matrix space and a vector space, respectively. By contrast, when the output dimension is one, the codomain is only the space of real numbers. Therefore, the extension of output dimension significantly mounts the difficulty of the whole proof."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, the discriminator of PGMGAN consists of multiple ResBlocks, which is relatively more capable. In addition, it can be seen from supplementary that for the natural image datasets, when the authors use the powerful StyleGAN2 discriminator (see Table 4 of supplementary), the FID scores that measures the quality of generated samples can be reduced to a very low level (eg, FID<10 on CelebA dataset, and see more quantitative results in Table 12-17 of supplementary), which shows that the proposed NF-based generator can also generate high quality samples when the discriminator is powerful enough."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

To encode interactions between substructures into the final learned molecular representation, the authors utilize the permutation equivariant Set Attention Block (SAB) proposed in Set Transformer [3]. SAB takes a representation set of any size as input and outputs a representation set of equal size. SAB is able to encode pairwise and higher-order interactions between elements in input sets into outputs. The authors add such a SAB after the Substructure Encoder. For each molecule, the authors feed the representions of its substructures to SAB to obtain new substruture representations. In this way, the final molecule representation could model interactions between substructures. Due to limited time, the authors only conduct experiments on EC50-assay/scaffold/size to examine the performance of adding such a SAB. As demonstrated in the table, the authors can see that adding such a SAB further improves the proposed model on EC50-scaffold.

The authors deem that it is interesting to investigate whether CQL can have better performance gain with the proposed CABI compared with TD3_BC. Due to the time limit, the authors can only run CQL+CABI over 4 different random seeds without tuning real data ratio $\\eta$. To be specific, the authors use real data ratio $\\eta=0.3$ for *random* datasets, $\\eta=0.7$ for *medium* and *medium-replay* datasets, and a comparatively large $\\eta=0.9$ for *medium-expert* and *expert* datasets (since they are of good quality). The forward horizon and backward horizon for rollout are set to be 3 for all of the datasets, which is consistent with the experimental setup for TD3_BC+CABI. The authors keep the original hyperparameters of CQL fixed. The authors summarize the experimental results in Table 1, where the authors observe that CQL does get large performance gain with the aid of CABI on all of the datasets.

The authors did get inspiration from Neural-Pull on how to learn distance fields by moving queries. However, the nature of SDF prevents Neural-Pull from representing most real-world objects with open surfaces or geometries with inner structures, and the direct extension of Neural-Pull to UDF fails drastically as shown in Table 5. This observation drives us to design a consistency-aware learning scheme with a carefully designed loss as described in Sec.3.2 which leads to an accurate and continuous field as shown in Fig 1 of the supplementary. In Sec.3.3, the authors proposed to progressively estimate the mapping relationship between 3D queries and the approximated surface by updating the raw point cloud with well-moved queries as additional priors for promoting further convergence. Finally, previous UDF approaches fail to extract surfaces directly which greatly limits their practicability. The authors resolve this problem by introducing an algorithm for directly extracting surfaces with arbitrary topology from the gradient vector field of UDF as described in Sec.3.4."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Using Algorithm $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-$\\text{Recovery}$, the authors show that the authors can learn these graphs approximately up to a distance approximation of $\\beta n$. \nIn a cluster $C^{\\star}_a$, the authors construct a partitioning of MAGs such that two MAGs belong to a partition if they are equal. The MAG corresponding to the largest partition is called dominant MAG. Using the proposed algorithm, the authors learn the dominant MAG correctly and return it as an output. As all the MAGs in the cluster $C^{\\star}_a$ satisfy $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-clustering property, the dominant MAG is within a distance of $\\beta n$ from the true MAG and therefore is a good approximation of the true MAG.\nFor learning dominant MAG, there are two steps. First, the authors select a node uniformly at random for every entity and intervene on the node and its neighbors to learn all the edges incident on the node. Next, the authors construct the dominant MAG by combining the neighborhoods of each individual node. Let $u$ be any node and $T_u$ denote the set of all entities which intervened on $u$ in the first step. Now, among all the neighborhoods identified by the entities in $T_u$, the authors do not know which of them correspond to that of the dominant MAG. In order to solve this issue, the authors use a threshold-based approach and assign a score to every entity in $T_u$. The score of an entity $i$ is the number of entities in $T_u$ that has the same neighborhood of $u$ as that of $i$. Finally, the authors select the entity with the maximum score and assign the neighborhood of the entity as the neighborhood of $u$ for the dominant MAG (Lines 12-15 in Algorithm $(\\alpha,\\beta)$-$\\text{Recovery})$.\nThe authors argue that if the cluster size is large (see Theorem 3.4), the neighborhoods of nodes using entities with maximum scores are equal to that of the dominant MAG. This is because the dominant MAG has the largest partition size, and if a sufficiently large number of entities (across all partitions) are assigned node $u$, then, many of them will be entities from the dominant MAG partition. So, the scores of entities in the dominant MAG partition will be higher compared to the scores of entities from other partitions."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

SimSiam is a self-supervised learning approach.\nThe problem with simple self-supervised representation learning is that after a few epochs, the model collapses to identity mapping because the loss would be zero. There are usually three ways to solve this problem: using negative samples [R3], applying online clustering [R4], and applying moving average [R5]. However, SimSiam can work surprisingly well with none of the above strategies for preventing model collapsing. The main technique SimSiam adopts is the stop-gradient operation, which only updates one branch at the training step. It is shown that the stop-gradient operation is sufficient to avoid collapsing solutions.\nHowever, current graph contrastive learning approaches are highly dependent on negative samples. Motivated by SimSiam and [R3] which indicate that negative samples are not necessarily required in the vision domain, of which the main benefit is to avoid careful treatment to retrieve the negative pairs, the authors explore the necessity of negative samples in the graph domain. Therefore, the authors follow the framework of SimSiam to revise the loss function as Eq. (9). The proposed experimental results indicate that negative samples are not necessarily required for graph contrastive learning. But negative samples would still work in some cases, such as when the graph data is very sparse in terms of graph topology and node features.\n\n[R1] Chen, X., & He, K. (2021).

It takes around 0.05 seconds to simulate a single FL epoch with 10 sampled clients without parallelization. Total training steps vary across defense policies as stated in the supplementary materials D.1. \n\nWith the above numbers, if the authors assume that each FL epoch takes 72 seconds to finish and there are in total of 1,000 FL epochs during FL training, then distribution learning will end before the 100th FL epoch and policy training ends by the 400th FL epochs, and the total FL training time is 20 hours. Once equipped with more powerful devices, the training time can be significantly reduced by parallelly simulating multiple clients using multiprocessing and multiple episodes using vectorized environments, which will make it possible to simulate large FL systems.  \n\nIn terms of executing time, for MNIST with clipping median defense, IPM takes around 0.25 seconds to execute an attack in each FL epoch, LMP takes around 7.7 seconds, EB takes around 0.5 seconds. The execution time of the proposed RL method varies over the action space used and it takes around 5.8 seconds with the current action space. Given that each FL epoch typically lasts a minute or longer (72 seconds in the proposed experiment), a few seconds of search time is completely acceptable. The authors observe that for defenses such as Krum, it suffices to use the gradients of the last two layers of model parameters as the action. This approach does not require any online searching and decreases the attack execution time to 0.5s. \n\n                           FL Epochs   Real Time\n     Distribution Learning   100      <= 2 hours\n     Policy Learning         400      <= 8 hours\n     Total FL Training       1000      20 hours\n\n\n                                      Real Executing Time\n      IPM                                   0.25s\n      LMP                                   7.7s\n      EB                                    0.5s\n      RL (with online search)               5.8s\n      RL (without online search)            0.5s"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Under a strong restriction that all activations are linear functions, Kawaguchi (2016), Zhou & Liang (2018), and Lu & Kawaguchi (2017) showed that all local minima are global minima, which accounts for the success of deep learning. However, it has been well observed and acknowledged that SGD can converge to points with large training errors, which are apparently not globally optimal. This phenomenon motivates us to study the existence of spurious local minima by relaxing this strong restriction. Theorem 1 of this paper (based on Lemmas 3 and 4) exactly constructs spurious local minima on the loss surface of a nonlinear neural network (with an arbitrary depth, a differentiable loss and an arbitrary-dimensional output). This counterexample proves that the existing theoretical results cannot be applied to nonlinear networks. Constructing counterexamples is a widely used approach to prove a proposition is wrong.

Its performance is somewhat as expected. First, NDQ has been shown to converge somewhat slower than baselines the authors choose, e.g. in Fig.7 of their paper for map 3s_vs_5z it starts to show non-zero test win rates after more than 5M training steps, while the authors only compare the results for the first 3M training steps since PAC and some other baselines are able to achieve a high win rate at 3M steps already. Second,  NDQ performs well in environments that need real-time agent-wise communication, e.g. on environments like hallway and  3b_vs_1h1m in SMAC, while it is absent in the proposed testing benchmarks, as the authors consider mainly hard maps in the proposed evaluation."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Finally, the authors feed the Supra-Hodge $k$-Laplacian into the proposed diffusion supra-Hodge convolution operation to to capture time-conditioned higher-order interactions on $\\mathcal{G}_t$ and to describe the dynamic diffusion of information over simplices along the temporal dimension. In the proposed experiments, the authors consider 0-simplices (nodes), 1-simplices (edges), and 2-simplices (filled triangles). \nSuggesting to explore the potential utility of 3-simplices is a great suggestion! Based on 1-simplices (edge), 2-simplices (filled triangles), and 3-simplex (tetrahedron) and the definition of Hodge-$k$ Laplacian, the authors can obtain Hodge 2-Laplacian and the corresponding Supra-Hodge $2$-Laplacian (via Equation~3 in Section 4.3). After that, the authors conduct comparison experiments between (i) ZFC-SH$^1$CN based on supra-Hodge $1$-Laplacian (i.e., utilizing information of 0-simplices, 1-simplices, and 2-simplices) and (ii) ZFC-SH$^2$CN based on supra-Hodge $1$-Laplacian (i.e., utilizing information of 1-simplices, 2-simplices, and 3-simplices). Tables 13 and 14 present the performances of ZFC-SH$^1$CN and ZFC-SH$^2$CN on PeMSD4 and COVID-19 (TX) datasets. The authors find that ZFC-SH$^1$CN consistently outperforms ZFC-SH$^2$CN.\nthe authors tend to attribute such findings to the fact that the authors observe a very low number of 3-simplices. For instance, in PeMSD4 at each timestamp the authors observe around $\\bf{29}$ 2-simplices (filled triangles) but the authors observe only around $\\bf{2}$ 3-simplices (tetrahedron).

Is it feasible to design an algorithm with the proposed objective that also updates the feature representation (using some different optimization method)? In that, I guess convergence guarantees and generalization bounds may not hold but may lead to better performance?", "reference_answer": "A: The proposed method can be easily adapted to an end-to-end automatic differentiation framework. Incorporating automatic representation learning into the proposed method is indeed highly desired because of its practical value in applications. The authors omitted the discussion of this topic in the proposed initial submission due to space limits, but will include it in the proposed revision if extra space is available.\nAlthough any representation learning model can be adopted, the authors focus on discussing the most popular one nowadays, the neural network model with end-to-end learning and automatic differentiation. The authors show how to make use of the proposed DRO method as the final loss layer in a neural network model. A network for supervised learning typically has a linear classification layer in the end without activation. Assume the penultimate layer outputs $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$ for input $\\boldsymbol{x}$, the last layer will typically output  $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) := \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$ for some $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is sometimes called logits and yields probability distribution with a softmax layer. For example, in univariate classification, $k$ is the number of labels. In dependency parsing, $k = n^2$ with $n$ being the number of tokens in the input sentence $\\boldsymbol{x}$. Given $b$-dimensional token-wise embeddings before the penultimate layer, the biaffine layer in BiAF yields $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n^2 \\times b^2}$ equivalently ($b^2$-dimensional feature vector for each arc). Thus $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is the logits for all the arcs. Note that $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in the proposed formulation is naturally equivalent to the parameters of the aforementioned last linear layer. Therefore having $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ is sufficient for us to compute $\\mathbb{P}^*_{Y|\\boldsymbol{x}}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}^*_{Y|\\boldsymbol{x}}$. In this way, the proposed method is the loss layer without learnable parameters, which backpropagates the sub-derivative of the objective with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ to the linear classification layer: $\\partial{\\text{Obj}}/\\partial{\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})} \\triangleq \\sum_{i = 1}^{B}  {\\mathbf q}^{(i)*} - {\\mathbf p}_{\\text{emp}}^{(i)}$, where $B$ is the batch size. Recall $\\mathbf{q}$ and ${\\mathbf p}_\\text{emp}$ are the probability vectors for $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{P}^{\\text{emp}}$ respectively. The sub-derivative of the regularization term with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is added to the classification layer. Although losing global convergent and provable generalization guarantees, the authors are now able to take advantage of automatic differentiation and focus on solving the minimax problem given $\\boldsymbol{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ and groundtruth $\\boldsymbol{y}$ for training. Since the computational bottleneck lies in computing $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ while GPU acceleration now does it for us, the overhead of computing the adversarial loss should not be much higher than that of computing the cross-entropy loss."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

This idea is first presented at Code2Vec and Code2Seq. The Code2seq obtains state-of-the-art of code summarization using only pairwise path information in AST. However, code2seq lacks the modelling of context, which leads us to explore combining the path representation with the source code context. Since the Transformer can model context well, the authors naturally consider integrating tree path encoding into Transformer.\n\n2) The other point comes from the proposed baselines(Great and CodeTransformer). These models design based on the Transformer, and both introduce the structural inductive bias in Transformer. Technically, they modify the positional encoding of the Transformer and use either manually designed structural edges or distance across AST to represent structural information. In this paper, the authors pursue the research line of combining the Transformer-based model with additional\nstructure information of source codes. \n\nEssentially, the difference between the proposed model and the proposed baselines is encoding path vs manually designed edges or distances. The path's different node combinations contain plenty of structure information, which is overlooked by encoding distances. To verify the benefit of learning from paths, the authors conduct ablation studies: before feeding the path into Transformer, the authors first convert all nodes in the path to the same one. In such a case, what the model learns is degenerate completely into hops across the syntax tree between two terminals.\nFor more details about ablation studies, please refer to L326-L340. \n\nPlease refer to the table below for clear comparisons.\n\n|Model|Context|Structure|\n|----|----|----|\n|Code2Seq|No|Pairwise Path|\n|Great|Yes|Manually Designed Edges|\n|XLNet|Yes|No|\n|CodeTransformer|Yes|Multiply Structural Distances|\n|TPTrans|Yes|Pairwise Path|\n\nThe pointer network enhances predictions by pointing at positions, and it has already been widely adopted in lots of seq2seq models (in both NLP and Code Intelligence).

I am considering the efficiency of this new method. Does the proposed method have the same computation budget as the old way?", "reference_answer": "A: The proposed method is more efficient than the old way. For example, TRX aggregates the temporal information through the arrangement and combination of spatial information pairs/triplets. The complexity will increase rapidly with the number increase of the input frames. Moreover, this combination of sparse frames is not suitable for processing long videos, and its recognition ability for complex actions will also be limited (some complex human actions cannot be represented by only 2 or 3 sparse sampled frames). A simple example is that pairs/triplets-based approaches cannot distinguish whether a person hits the desk 3 times or 4 times. Because the maximum number of sampling frames is only 3, and it is difficult for the model to understand this repetitive action beyond triplet. The proposed method is to directly generate frame level spatio-temporal representation, which already contains rich temporal information, so the laborious combination operation is omitted. It can be considered as a more concise and general video feature alignment method.

If the step-sizes are selected too big, then the recursion cannot converge to the stationary point in a fixed small number of iterations which may result in divergence of the overall SGD.

In such cases, the authors can simply use the solution given by an offline LP or SDP solver on a prior instance of the dataset as predictions. Therefore, predictors are readily and easily available for a wide class of natural datasets. Furthermore, classical online algorithms are overly pessimistic and it is conceivable that in many practical applications, future inputs to online algorithms can be predicted using ML methods, which can also serve as predictions. This new paradigm for online algorithms has been adopted for a wide array of fundamental online algorithms, including scheduling and caching.

From the problem definition side, the authors are the first to study the relationship between self-supervised learning and adversarial robustness in the 3D space, which was largely unexplored. This is a new and important research problem. It contains essential differences in studying the relationship between 3D adversarial robustness and 3D SSL compared to the 2D domain. For instance, different from prior work in adversarial robustness in 2D vision that either leverages a single SSL task [1] or targets a single backbone model [2], 3D point cloud recognition using deep learning is a relatively nascent field, where finding proper universal “3D backbones” is still an active research direction. Understanding which 3d backbone is more robust in the early stage could help guide the community towards the right direction. Therefore, it is necessary to consider different types of learning architectures to study their robustness. Moreover, given the intrinsic sparsity and set property of 3D point cloud data, various 3D point cloud domain-specific attack threat models (e.g. point shifting, point adding, and point dropping) should be investigated. Therefore, in this paper, the authors conduct a much more comprehensive study along multiple 3D domain-specific dimensions to study its robustness including three 3D SSL tasks, three different types of attack threats, and three backbone architectures based on the properties of point cloud data. It is also worth noting that we, for the first time, formulate point adding (PA) and dropping (PD) adversaries into a general AT analysis framework. As also mentioned by the reviewer, the authors believe such a study could be useful to the community and future research in this domain. \n2. From the technical perspective, improving the adversarial robustness of 3D point clouds with self-supervised learning tasks is a non-trivial problem. The authors find that while some designs in 3D point cloud models work well in standard training, but they fail to provide robustness in adversarial training. The reason is that these designs introduce **randomness** in the inner maximization stage of adversarial training, causing the overall training intractable. For example, as illustrated in Section 3.2, the authors find that several components in PointNet and PCT (e.g., T-Net and farthest point sampling (FPS)) cannot work well by directly applying adversarial training. T-Net applies an overall transformation matrix to the point clouds and middle layer features, where a small perturbation in the matrix could affect all the features. Therefore, T-Net will introduce a high variance of performance in adversarial training. PCT originally leverages farthest point sampling (FPS) to sample anchors to do local clustering. Since the point cloud is dynamically changing in adversarial training, the sampled anchors are totally different in each PGD iteration, which will make models confusing. Therefore, the trained model is still not robust. The authors apply multiple modifications, including replacing the FPS operation with EdgeConv to stabilize the adversarial training (detailed in Section 3.2 and Appendix B). The capacity of EdgeConv is a superset of FPS operation since it views every point as an anchor and performs clustering so that it removes the randomness introduced by FPS. **Such a change does not modify the usage of the transformer in PCT, as shown in Appendix B, and will improve both clean and robust accuracy for the baseline.**\n3. From the experimental analysis side, the proposed analysis unveils multiple insights which are unique in 3D point cloud learning. For example, [2] shows that jigsaw SSL does not perform as well as rotation in 2D vision for robustness enhancement. However, 3D jigsaw helps connect the global and local feature learning, which improves a lot in 3D adversarial training. The authors also take the first step to analyze the robustness in the part segmentation task and provide valuable insights. \n4. The proposed ensemble methods are based on the proposed transferability analysis of different adversarially fine-tuned models that preserve different vulnerabilities. Therefore, simple but effective ensemble methods can tangibly improve the robustness. In contrast, [4] leverages different attacks/threats to adversarially train the ensemble model. The authors believe that the proposed study highlights different insights from [4]. \nThe authors believe a systematic study with insights should be considered a more critical factor, especially in the adversarial machine learning community, since fancier solutions may give a false sense of security that would be adaptively broken [3]. The proposed study further motivates future research on designing more robust operations, architectures, and SSL tasks in 3D vision.\n\n[1] Hendrycks, Dan, et al. \"Using Self-Supervised Learning Can Improve Model Robustness and Uncertainty.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 32 (2019): 15663-15674.\n[2] Chen, Tianlong, et al. \"Adversarial robustness: From self-supervised pre-training to fine-tuning.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2020.\n[3] Athalye, Anish, Nicholas Carlini, and David Wagner. \"Obfuscated gradients give a false sense of security: Circumventing defenses to adversarial examples.\" International conference on machine learning.

Is this almost quite similar to feature matching, but instead of directly matching them using standard metrics, the authors matched it with an optimization criterion? Do you think this is the reason that the proposed algorithm produces quite realistic-looking images?", "reference_answer": "A: It is an interesting question. Intuitively, the proposed method predicts by computing the similarity (measured by the conjugate kernel) between a real image and a set of distilled images. If the authors want this similarity measure to be accurate, making the distilled data features look closer to that of real data is better. Therefore, realistic-looking seems like a natural result of applying the proposed method. However, multiple factors can affect the appearance of the proposed distilled images. For example, Appendix C.4 shows that learning the label can play an important role; Appendix C.6 shows that the width, depth, normalization, and skip connection can also affect the appearance. Therefore, the authors also need to choose the right model architecture to generate realistic-looking images.\n\nHowever, the authors do not think the proposed method is very similar to feature matching. The key difference is that the proposed objective is indeed task-driven and requires labels to find the most discriminative feature for a particular task. However, the feature matching generally matches some feature statistics of the real and distilled data. It is likely that they only capture some general features that are useful to recover the data but not very useful for the downstream task. This is why the previous methods, like gradient matching and distribution matching, fail on the fine-grained classification task (Table 1. CUB-200), as many fine-grained classes share the same distilled features, thus providing no discriminative ability. Another difference is that feature matching objectives are not amenable for label learning, which is crucial for complex label spaces (e.g., ImageNet-1K, CUB-200). Thus, it is difficult for them to consider the class similarity information, so it becomes hard to learn the sharable information across different classes, resulting in a poor compression rate. Moreover, another drawback of surrogate objectives like gradient matching or feature matching is that it is unclear how far it is from the true objective. It is pretty tricky to measure how \"biased\" those objectives are. It is unclear whether the correct set of features (e.g., last layer or middle layer's activation or gradient) is used or whether a proper distance measure (e.g., L2 distance, cosine distance) is used. The authors conjecture that this biased objective is why previous methods do not show real-looking images. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Because of it, previous experimental and modeling works suggest that songbird learning is driven by node perturbation. \nBy contrast, most of the biologically-plausible learning rules still lack experimental support. \nSecondly, synaptic plasticity in the brain is typically modulated by global error signals provided by neuromodulators. This is consistent with node perturbation, but not with many of biologically-plausible learning rules that rely on a tailored local error signals. \nThirdly, neural activity in the brain is inherently stochastic. Node perturbation can naturally make use of this variability, while noise robustness of other biologically-plausible learning rules remains unclear.\nAnother line of motivation for us to study node perturbation is to understand the bias-variance tradeoff in biologically plausible credit assignment mechanisms. \nBiologically plausible learning rules are inevitably either biased against SGD or noisier than SGD (see Fig. 2 of BA Richards et al., 2020, Nat Neurosci), but it remains unclear which learning rules the brain should use.  The authors believe the proposed study sheds light on when the brain shouldn't use a noisy update rule, and when it might be possible to make use of it."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

First, the perturbation will not affect human perception much. Second, the perturbation is more than effective to break the clean trained models.\n\nPoint shifting (PS) is a well-established attack in prior literature [1,2,3]. The authors follow the experimental setups in [3] in the proposed study since [3] is the only one that also targets adversarial training-based methods. The authors believe this threat model does make sense. As Table 1 shows, the proposed L-inf norm distance $\\epsilon = 0.05$ reduces all the clean trained models’ robust accuracy to 0 or near 0. The authors have also tested that even with $\\epsilon = 0.02$, the adversary can still reduce all the models’ robust accuracy to less than 5%. On the other hand, the perturbed point clouds with $\\epsilon = 0.05$ are at the edge of correct human predictions of objects.\nAs the authors are not allowed to insert links, the authors kindly refer the reviewer to Figure 9 in [3], which also indicates the same conclusion. Numerically, $\\epsilon = 0.05$ out of [-1,1] is also similar to the commonly used  $\\epsilon = \\frac{8}{255}$ in 2D adversarial training [4]. \n\nUnlike point shifting (PS) attacks, there is no defensive analysis point adding (PA) and dropping (PD) attacks since they are bounded by L-0 distance which is not differentiable. Adding or dropping a large amount of points will also have a major effect on human perception [1,5]. In the published paper that proposes PA attack [1], they suggest adding 50 to 100 points bounding by informal Chamfer distance. Therefore, the authors adopt their experimental setting to make sure that the proposed threat model will not affect human perception. Since the attacker only has the ability to modify these newly added 100 points, it cannot reduce the accuracy to near 0. Similarly, the original paper that proposes PD has claimed dropping 200 points has great potential to even fool human perception [5]. Therefore, the authors restrict the proposed threat model to be able to drop 100 points. The proposed evaluation results are also consistent with [5] in terms of both clean and robust accuracy. \n\nTherefore, the authors believe that the proposed threat models are reasonable."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Because of this, even if the authors incorporate s into the w-network of PaCo, it is still different from soft-modularization.

By “less flexible in some cases”, the authors actually meant “less desirable/applicable in some cases”. For example, in cases where the authors want to conduct some task-specific operations, e.g., w-reset, it is not straightforward to do so in soft-modularization since the authors cannot find parameters that are dedicated to a specific task, because of the fact that all the networks have a “dependency on state”.

Taking CUB dataset ($312$ attributes) as an example, the attribute prototypes are trainable parameters of dim=$C\\times 312$ ($C$ is backbone feature channel), which are trained via back-propagation and shared by all images in CUB. The **different point** is that, when testing an image, APN directly uses the well-trained attribute prototypes to localize attribute-related regions for an image. Differently, DPPN first adjusts attribute prototypes according to visual contents of the testing image, and then uses these adjusted attribute prototypes to localize regions. Usually, the attribute prototypes will be adjusted several times (we found that adjusting three times obtains the best performance), thus the authors call DPPN “progressively adjusts attribute prototypes for an input image”. Based on such a progressive adjusting process, the final attribute prototypes for different images are different in DPPN, which the authors call “dynamically adjust attribute prototypes for different images”.

In more detail, as mentioned in the present paper, the KL-divergence in Eq (6) forces the distribution to be estimated to share its support with the preference distribution. This property may not be desired in some tasks where the attention structures are broadly applied. For example, in a translation task, the target sentence is unchanged if the authors replace some words in the source sentence with their synonyms (like replacing \"good\" with \"nice\"). Such a property of the data is not accounted for in the design of current attention because the KL-divergence forces models to put zero weights on the words not in the source sentence. This problem is discussed and solved in the proposed follow-up paper by replacing the KL divergence with an optimal transport-based measure, where the words \"similar\" to the ones in the source sentence will also be attended. The technique introduced in [2] is likely to help reduce the computation complexity for that purpose. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Thus, the authors apply the typical RKD method to train a new model and use Re-MKD to improve knowledge transferring. After the authors obtain a new model, the second training stage becomes a typical long-tail KD training, and the authors attempt to fine-tune it by tackling LT-KD.

In this case, for example, if the authors have the prior knowledge that \"pick-place\" is more similar to tasks such as window-open/window-close/door-open/drawer-open than some other task (e.g., button-press top-down), the authors may have an opportunity to guide the model to learn a better policy for \"pick-place\".

For the initial version of the MCB operator, the authors cannot directly utilize it since it may be intractable to acquire the maximum over a continuous action space, and the behavior policy is often unknown. Then, the authors propose the practical MCB operator, where the authors fit an empirical behavior policy $\\hat{\\mu}$ and construct the pseudo target values based on it. The authors present theoretical analysis on the practical MCB operator in Proposition 4 and 5. Furthermore, the authors extend the practical MCB operator into the deep RL setting, and propose MCQ algorithm. In deep RL, it is challenging to figure out whether the learned policy will execute OOD actions. The authors therefore regularize all actions sampled from the learned policy. The authors deem that the whole logic of the proposed work is clear.

Both conduct extensive experiments on the-state-of-art models on a set of benchmark datasets. However, CLEVRTEX focuses on the characteristics and comparison of different models. The proposed work, on the other hand, aims to quantify properties/inductive biases of synthetic and real-world datasets, and then discover what dataset factors incur the failure of existing models on challenging images. Notably, the authors employ real-world datasets instead of only complex synthetic datasets for systematically evaluation.\n\n_Inductive Biases.., Papa et.al.,_: This paper presents a very detailed study on the performance of MONet and SlotAtt on several synthetic datasets, so as to analyze architectural biases in the design of both models. The proposed work has similar findings on the inductive biases of MONet and SlotAtt, which can be found in the newly added Section 4.5. Apart from the study on biases of SOTA models with synthetic datasets, the proposed work also analyzes their failure on real-world datasets with extensive ablation experiments.\n\nIn summary, in the two relevant works, their experiments are still limited to synthetic images and they tend to characterize and analyze architectural designs of different models. By comparison, the proposed work benchmarks existing models on real-world datasets. Since all mentioned models fail on real-world datasets, architectural analysis is barely enough. Instead, the authors summarize and quantify inductive biases across different datasets. From the proposed experiments, the authors find that different models present different sensitivity to different dataset properties/biases, which also validates the findings of other study.

That is the reason why the authors consider mean message aggregation in the analysis section.

So the authors assume that due to such property of the JS dataset, it is harder to extract useful structural information from the path than other datasets. In addition, the authors are also surprised to find that the length and variance of paths of the Ruby dataset are smaller than other datasets. Meanwhile, the gain of TPTrans over baselines on Ruby datasets are more significant than others(please refer to A3 for details). \n\nBut unfortunately, as to the outlier of path length and variance of JS languages, the authors have not yet reached an accurate conclusion. \nOne possible line of reasoning is that the inherent property of Js language results in a much complicated syntax tree. \nThe authors also suspect that this is due to the internal design of the language parser, and perhaps a better parser might alleviate this problem."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

(1) As shown in Line 41-45 of the proposed work and also in [17], by using the Gaussian heatmap as the demander/target, the standard deviations of the Gaussian distributions often need to be carefully chosen, which is non-trivial. (2) As shown in Fig. 3 and Line 341-347 of the proposed work, while the human pose estimation task aims to localize body joints accurately, by using the Gaussian heatmap as the demander/target, the predicted heatmap is not very compact. This can lead to difficulties in accurately localizing the body joints.\n\nMeanwhile, the proposed pipeline can alleviate the misalignment problem between the training loss and the final body joint localization performance (as elaborated in **A5**). Also, as shown in Fig. 3 of the proposed work, by using the proposed pipeline with sub-pixels demander, a more compact body joint localization can be achieved. Thus, the body joints can be localized more accurately. By using the proposed pipeline, the authors also bypass the step of choosing proper standard deviations.\n\nthe authors also compare between sub-pixels demander and Gaussian heatmap with the same backbone model (HRNet-W48) and on the same set (COCO validation set).

The only complication here is that ProcTHOR houses can vary significantly in size and, as shown in Table 1, larger houses generally result in lower FPS. The iTHOR scenes from AI2-THOR are all one-room houses and are approximately equivalent to the \"Small\" houses from Table 1.\n\nRegarding other comparisons, this is a great question and is surprisingly challenging to answer for several reasons:\n\nDifferent simulators support different agents, each with their own action spaces and capabilities, with little standardization across simulators. AI2-THOR, and thus ProcTHOR as well, supports three different agent types: \"high-level\", \"locobot\", and \"arm\". The \"arm\" agent is often slower to simulate than the navigation-only \"locobot\" agent as it is more complex to physically model a 6 DoF arm as it interacts with objects. This is made even more complex when noting that random action sampling, the simplest policy with which to benchmark, is a poor profiling strategy as some actions are only computationally expensive in rare, but important, settings; for instance, computing arm movements is most expensive when the arm is interacting with many objects, these interactions are rare when randomly sampling but we'd expect them to dominate when using a well-trained agent.\n\nSome simulators are relatively slow when run on a single process but can be easily parallelized with many processes running on a single GPU, e.g. AI2-THOR. Thus single-process simulation speeds may be highly deceptive as they do not capture the ease of scalability.\n\nWhen training agents via reinforcement learning, there are a large number of factors that bottleneck training speed and so the value of raw simulator speed is substantially reduced. These factors include:\n\nModel forward pass when computing agent rollouts.\nModel backward pass when computing gradients for RL losses.\nEnvironment resets - for many simulators (e.g. ProcTHOR, Habitat) it is orders of magnitude more expensive to change a scene than it is to take a single agent step. This can be extremely problematic when using synchronous RL algorithms as all simulators will need to wait for a single simulator when that simulator is resetting. When training this means that, in practice, important \"tricks\" are employed to ensure that scene changes are infrequent or synchronized, without these tricks, performance may be dramatically lower.\nTo attempt to control for the above factors, the authors set up two profiling experiments, one in Habitat HM3D and one using ProcTHOR-10K, where we:\n\nUse a 2-GPU machine (GeForce RTX 2080 GPUs) where GPU-0 is reserved for the agent's actor-critic policy network and GPU-1 is reserved for simulator instances.\n\nTrain agents for the ObjectNav task (using the same LoCoBot agent with the same action space).\n\nFor both agents, use the same actor-critic policy network, the same referenced in the paper.\n\nRemove the \"End\" action so that agents always take the maximum 500 steps, this minimizes dependence on the learned policy.\n\nUse a rollout length of 128 with the same set of training hyperparameters across both models.\n\nUse a total of 28 parallel simulator processes, this approximately saturates GPU-1 memory. The authors found that Habitat instances used slightly less GPU memory than ProcTHOR instances and so the authors could likely increase the number instances for Habitat slightly, but the authors kept these equal for more direct comparison.\n\nUse a scene update \"trick\" which forces all simulators to advance to the next scene in a synchronous fashion after every 10 rollouts (e.g. after every 10 x 128 x 28 = 35,840 total steps across all simulators).\n\nThe authors ran the above profiling experiments for ~1M steps and the authors found that training with Habitat resulted in FPS ranging between 119.7-264.3 (230.5 average) and training with ProcTHOR resulted in FPS ranging between 145.5-179.4 (167.7 average). Training in ProcTHOR is thus slower than in Habitat but, for the above set up, this difference is around 1.4x rather than what the difference in single process rendering speed would suggest. While the authors did not have the time to profile Gibson, iGibson, or Habitat-2.0 in this rebuttal period, these simulators are generally stated to have single-process rendering speeds between AI2-THOR and Habitat and so the authors expect their FPS numbers between the two above ranges."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The importance sampling ratio is derived by maximizing Q-values, subject to a KL-constraint between current policy $\\pi$ and the behavior policy $\\mu$. However, BRAC aims to encourage the learned policy to be close to the behavior policy by adding a regularization term. Therefore, the most significant difference between ICQ and BRAC is: ICQ can eliminate the extrapolation error to zero theoretically based on the analysis in Theorem 1. In contrast, BRAC eliminates the extrapolation error empirically.\n2) By applying the constraint implicitly, ICQ avoids an additional regularization term or even training a separate network as BCQ does, which contributes ICQ to be a simple yet efficient method. In contrast, BRAC has to balance the additional regularization term and other optimization goals."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The goal was to bring to spotlight an important class of problems and algorithms related to model compression to the DP literature. Model compression is an extremely active area of research in non-private world ([43] for a survey), yet it has not received similar attention in the DP community. Case in point: there is not a single ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS paper on the topic. The authors believe that the model compression problem considered in the proposed work (where a single large model such as BERT is compressed into small BERT during fine-tuning stage) is new and different from the settings considered in other papers. Furthermore, the proposed setting is more relevant to deployment of NLP models such as BERT, GPT2 etc. for common NLP tasks such as natural language understanding and next word prediction. \nFrom a technical standpoint, the authors believe that their paper shows some interesting results in DPIMP including its connections to the Lottery ticket hypothesis (the authors would love to hear your feedback on these sets of experiments since DPIMP provides better performance than DPKD). The authors believe that zero-shot initialization strategies for student models in DPKD is pretty surprising in its effectiveness in closing the gap. Given the importance of this problem, the authors think the proposed work gives a substantial baseline for more work to follow. \nFinally, the authors believe that identifying a right and important problem, bringing the attention of the community towards solving it is in itself a worthy goal.  \n\nX1: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade/2020/planning-management/process/disclosure-avoidance.html\nX2: Survey https://differentialprivacy.org/dp-fine-tuning/"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Different values have different impacts on parameter-sharing and sample efficiency.\n- Smaller K (much smaller than task number T) will have a stronger enforcement on parameter sharing. It can be observed that with a too strong parameter sharing setting (e.g. K=3 in Table 3a) will limit its performance due to its over-constrained policy parameter space representable by $\\mathbf{\\Phi} \\mathbf{w}$.\n\n- Larger K (e.g. comparable to task number T) offers a larger representation space, but at the same time enforces less on parameter sharing, which will decrease sample efficiency (i.e., learns slower)."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

It also comes from the proposed experiments and understandings in SNN field. However, the authors designed the ESG method form meticulously and carefully. From large amount of experiments and thoughts, the authors find two RULEs of designing K(i). First, it should have a growing trend. As explained in Section 4.3, using EvAF with a smaller k results in the SNN with strong weight-updating ability; while a larger k results in accuracy gradients. To obtain both weight updating ability in the early stage of training and accurate backward gradient at the end of the training, K(i) should have a growing trend. Second, it should enjoy long-term maintenance of weight updating ability. As shown in Fig. 4 in the paper, due to the stronger weight-updating ability, SNNs with the EvAF using a fixed smaller k are much easier to converge to better results than these using a fixed larger k. This means EvAF with smaller k values taking up more training time is better. According to these rules, the authors choose K(i) with exponential growth rather than other linear or logarithmic growth.\n\n---"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

How is the matrix X computed?", "reference_answer": "A: In this paper, since the authors aim to propose a transformer that is generic and applicable to different brain networks, the most commonly way to construct a brain network is adopted, which the authors excluded due to the page limit. Take functional brain network as an example, to generate the matrix $X$, a brain atlas or a set of Regions of Interest (ROI) are first selected to define the nodes. Then, the representative fMRI BOLD series from each node are obtained by either averaging or performing SVD on the time series from all the voxels within the node. Various measures have been proposed for assessing brain connectivity between pairs of nodes. The authors adopted the simplest and most frequently used method in the neuroimaging community where connections are calculated as the pairwise correlations between BOLD time courses from two ROIs. After selecting the Functional Connectivity (FC) measure, the strength of connectivity between each pair of nodes in the brain network is evaluated.

For any $\\epsilon >0$, the tie will be broken. By letting $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the authors find the tightest bound of the number of poisoned samples needed from the proposed construction.

Any guarantees on this? What if novel features lie in a sparse region where the closest base features are far? Would it cause instability for centroid estimation? ", "reference_answer": "A: As the features of both the base data and novel data are pre-trained through the same backbone network, it is highly unlikely that novel features lie in a sparse region where the closest base features are far. To verify this point, \nwe calculate the feature similarity between the base data and novel data in the few-shot learning setting. To make it more challenging, the authors choose the Meta-dataset where there is a very large domain gap where the novel data domains (e.g., Quickdraw and Omniglot) are prominently different from the base data (i.e., miniImageNet). In detail, \nwe define $\\lambda$ as the cosine similarity between the centroid of the support data and the base data. When the authors use $\\lambda>0.6$ as the condition to select the most similar neighborhoods, the authors see that the neighborhood size varies from 290 (when Omini is set as the novel set) to 8168 (when miniImage-test is set as the novel set). In these settings, the authors observe stable improvement over the baseline method (i.e., S2M2). \nThis suggests that the authors can find k-nearest neighbors from the base data for the centroid estimation in current FSL evaluation settings. There are two potential explanations. Firstly, realistic images (even from different domains) tend to share some common underlying characteristics (e.g., low-level cues like texture or color which are verified to be shared across domains [1]). Secondly, recent FSL methods generally pretrain a  backbone network on base data via contrastive learning to improve the generalization ability, while representations learned by contrastive learning uniformly locate on the hypersphere[2]. Thus the projection of novel data to the base data can easily find neighborhoods in dense regions.\n\n|                         | mini-test         | CoCo               | CUB              | Fungi            | Omini            | Sign            | QDraw           |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| baseline                | $64.63$           | $63.06$           | $47.75$          | $42.36$          | $77.28 $         | $53.50$         | $51.60$         |\n| TCPR               | $68.06_{k=10000}$ | $64.32_{k=5000}$ | $51.87_{k=5000}$ | $44.38_{k=5000}$ | $78.51_{k=100} $ | $54.83_{k=100}$ | $54.62_{k=100}$ |\n| TCPR($\\lambda>0.6$) | $67.72_{k=8168}$  | $63.81_{k=6032}$   | $51.57_{k=6437}$ | $44.27_{k=4092}$ | $78.06_{k=290} $ | $54.22_{k=890}$ | $53.56_{k=367}$ |\n\nMoreover, the proposed automatic way of choosing the value of $k$ works for all datasets, with accuracy close to the best one found by grid search. \n[1] Zhao N, et al. what makes instance discrimination good for transfer learning?

The latency of each block is estimated using the latency prediction model by considering the latency of both data movement and computation. More detailed description of the proposed latency prediction model is included in the updated paper and supplementary material.\n\nA: The setup of operator fusion is decided based on the averaged sparsity of a block. For example, when the sparsity is high (very few pixels are selected), the latency bottleneck would be memory access rather than computation. In this situation, it would be more efficient to conduct operator fusion. The authors calculate the averaged sparsity of each block on the ImageNet validation set and decide whether to fuse some operations. This is practical thanks to the proposed latency prediction model, which helps us to efficiently analyze the latency bottleneck.\n\nA: Although skipping the entire block as in Conv-AIG (or the proposed coarsest granularity S=56-28-14-7) is easier to implement for fast inference, it might degrade the network performance (please also refer to the proposed response to Question 5).

In Table 3, [3] (goal-oriented reward) and [2] (fidelity-oriented reward based on nDTW) corresponds to model#15 and model#16 respectively. The [1] (fidelity-oriented reward based on CLS) does not correspond to any rows.   \n2. In addition, there are a few differences between the proposed reproduced methods and prior works. [2] proposes the nDTW to replace the CLS metric and uses the gain in nDTW score after taking an action as the reward signal, but the proposed experimental results show that this reward type does not perform well on Loss Number metric (LN: 5426). So the authors formulate the fidelity-oriented reward based on nDTW as 'fidelity metric + SR' (model#16, LN: 5309), which is an effective formation for fidelity-oriented rewards that was first defined in [1]. For the goal-oriented reward, since trajectories in the R2R dataset are all the shortest trajectories to the goals, [3] use the reduced distance after taking an action as an extra reward signal in addition to the SR signal. However, 44.5% of RxR trajectories are not the shortest trajectories from the start to the goal location as described in the Path Statistic section of [4]. So the authors did not include the reduced distance part in the goal-oriented reward as mentioned in footnote 1 (page 8) in the paper.  \nReferences:\n[1] Vihan Jain, Gabriel Magalhaes, Alexander Ku, Ashish Vaswani, Eugene Ie, and Jason Baldridge.

Moreover, Daskalakis et al. (2021) show, that the computation of approximate first-order locally optimal solutions is intractable for general variational inequalities. Therefore, it makes sense to consider non-monotone problems with a certain structure. The authors point out that only one problem class (out of 6 considered in the paper) relies on monotonicity. All other cases do cover some special non-monotone operators. Indeed, Assumptions 1.5 and 1.6 do not imply monotonicity (see lines 114-115 and 122-125). \nMoreover, the authors would like to emphasize the generality of the SNC assumption (Assumption 1.4). This assumption is very mild. For instance, when the operator $F$ is $L$-Lipschitz, it is automatically star-negative strongly-monotone with $\\mu=-L$, i.e.,\n$<F(x^*),x-x^*> \\geq - L ||x-x^*||^2,$ and $1/L$-comonotonicity is a slightly stronger condition (if $||F(x^*)|| \\approx L||x-x^*||$ then the authors recovers $<F(x^*),x-x^*> \\gtrsim - 1/L ||F(x^*)||^2$). So, it holds for many $L$-Lipschitz operators automatically. The proposed assumption is similar to the works using the weakest notion of structured non-monotonicity initially proposed for the analysis of EG-type methods by Diakonikolas et al.

So, their statement “$dX/d\\theta$ is not computable” is correct. This is an argument for the case that tries to apply the theory of EGN to general CO problems, which always encounters such non-differentiable difficulty.  For the specific cases studied in EGN, EGN adopts “$d\\bar{X}/d\\theta$” (not $dX/d\\theta$), which essentially follows a relaxation as this paper suggests. However, EGN does not derive the relaxation principle as ours, although the used relaxation happens to satisfy the proposed principle. The above description implies a gap between EGN’s theory for general CO problems and its implementation for the two cases studied in [A]. In the EGN paper, the theory is only in the probabilistic sense and works for just discrete objectives (see Eq.(3) and Thm 1 in [A]).  However, the implementation in EGN for the max-clique and graph-partition problems does not strictly follow the probabilistic model but relaxes discrete variables $X$ into their continuous counterparts $\\bar{X}$. Such replacement cannot achieve the performance guarantee claimed by EGN for general CO problems, because the expectation in general does not always equal to the relaxation.

To be more specific, let us recall the dynamic update rules  (5), (6), (7) respectively. In [15], rule (5) is only applied to the case p=1 (See Lines 183-196 for discussion about (5)). It was observed already in [24, Section 8.1] that IRLS-p using rule (6) does not exhibit a good global convergence behavior if $p < 0.5$ (for the compressed sensing problem), which is consistent to what the authors observe also for robust regression. \n\nA: The update rules (6) and (7) are further compared for Lp minimization in Figure 1b, and the authors see that (7) performs much better. From a theoretical point of view as well, the local superlinear convergence radius implied by rule (7) is much larger than the one implied by rule (6), as discussed in Lines 236-244.\n\nA: Note that the only difference between (6) and (7) is that (7) takes the best $\\alpha$-term approximation, while (6) takes the ($\\alpha+1$)-th largest element from the residual. Without a proof, the authors suspect that the reason that (6) performs worse is because the smoothing parameter of (6) is decreased too fast at each iteration, resulting in sub-optimality (consider a similar situation where the regularization parameter for the log-barrier function should not be increased too fast in the interior point method).\n\nA: As a summary, it can be said that both theory and empirical behavior of IRLS are sensitive to the precise choice of the update rule, and are the reason why the authors choose rule (7). While both rule (6) and (7) enjoy empirical global linear convergence for p=1 (Figure 1a), the authors are only able to prove this for (7). Finally, it should be remarked that, even though (7) is the best update rule that the authors are aware of and it is crucial for the proposed analysis, it is unclear to us how to design an optimal update rule for the smoothing parameter that can further improve IRLS."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The original paper by Chow and Liu [1] has 3000+ citations and their algorithm has been used for numerous applications in a wide variety of scientific fields. Recent work [2, 3] has shown that the Chow-Liu algorithm is the optimal algorithm for estimating tree-structured distributions. This leads to a natural question: Is Chow-Liu the optimal algorithm for estimating an important statistic of a tree-structured distribution, such as its entropy? the proposed work shows that the answer, surprisingly, is “no”. The authors show that the Chow-Liu algorithm requires $\\Omega(d^2)$ pairwise samples to estimate Shannon entropy, while the proposed algorithm requires only $O(d)$ pairwise samples.\n2. In lines 29 - 34 the authors described wearable health-monitoring devices as a natural application for private and distributed entropy estimation. Another application is fingerprinting detection on the web [4]. Many websites track users without their consent by recording information about their devices, a practice called fingerprinting. Entropy is the standard metric used to quantify the identifiability of the collected fingerprints. So a private and distributed method for estimating entropy can be used by a browser to warn users that this covert tracking is occurring, without ever storing the fingerprints themselves. This approach has been proposed by Google Chrome [5]\n3. In NeurIPS 2021, the authors of [6] posed an open problem: Is there a non-interactive private algorithm for estimating Gini entropy with sample complexity that has no dependence on the support size of the distribution? (See page 10 of their paper, final paragraph.) the authors answer this question affirmatively, thereby resolving the open problem."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The use of uniformly random corruptions was to keep the model simple. The proposed algorithm works as long as the corrupted suggestions are drawn from a \"diffuse\" distribution over pages: namely, when each page is drawn with probability at most $O(1/\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon)) \\cdot 1/k$. \nThat said, it seems difficult to remove all assumptions on the corrupted suggestions. Indeed, the authors have a very weak signal (we want correctness only with probability $\\varepsilon$), so if the bad suggestions are  adversarial (and put a lot of the remaining $1-\\varepsilon$ probability measure on a small set of pages which should not be evicted, since they are requested again in this phase), it seems difficult to beat an $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ competitive ratio.

The authors hope that the proposed work leads to further investigation of these kinds of oracles. Interestingly, independent work of Gamlath et al.

Is it obvious that this is true for the new CCA objective used here? Furthermore, why are the other assumptions satisfied, i.e., why is the gradient bounded, and why are the iterates bounded?", "reference_answer": "A: Geodesically convex: The authors are not sure  if the reviewer is referring to a specific theorem in the references or the paper. The authors do not require the *objective* to be geodesically convex but only need the {$A_t$} (manifold valued variables) in Prop. 4 to lie inside a geodesic ball of radius less than the convexity radius. This assumption is standard for manifold based statistical models due to the presence of varying sectional curvature [1,7,9]. \n\nBounded gradient: The objective functions, $\\widetilde{F}$ and $\\widetilde{F}_{pca}$ are Lipschitz continuous as the population covariance matrices are assumed to be bounded. This implies that the Euclidean gradient is bounded, and as the Riemannian covariant derivative is upper bounded by the Euclidean gradient, the authors can conclude that a constant to bound gradient in Proposition 4 exists. In practice, this step does not lead to numerical issues in the proposed implementation. \n\nBounded iterates: This is derived directly by \"inverting\" the specified tolerance level. The proposed objective is defined using a finite sum. Since the authors use a stochastic algorithm, the number of iterations sufficient to reach the tolerance level is based on using the error on iteration $t$ (used in showing the convergence rate) and solving for $t$. In order to get $\\epsilon$ tolerance, the authors need a number of iterates bounded by $O(N + D/\\epsilon^2)$ for some constant $D > 0$ which depends on Lipschitz constant for the objective function and the sectional curvature bound of the underlying manifold (denoted by $\\kappa$ in Proposition 4).

If the authors increase the number of objects (i.e., from 3x3 to 3x7 balls), the authors find that it failed to search a motion path in a limited time (i.e. 10 minutes). \n\nThe authors notice that such a solution is of two main limitations: \n1. Open-loop planning:  The proposed goal and the initial state may not be reachable or far away from each other.\n2. Accessibility of the generated goal: The goal proposer ignores the environment dynamics. So the generated goal may be physically inaccessible (e.g. objects overlap with each other), as shown in Fig.4 in the supplementary.\n\nAs demonstrated in the ball arrangement experiments, the above two limits lead to weak performance : \n1. In Fig. 5 of the main paper, the likelihood curves of goal-based methods are significantly below ours.  In Table 1 of the supplementary, the average length of trajectories of goal-based methods is significantly below ours (e.g., In Circling + Clustering, the averaged state change of Ours(SAC) 48.93 +- 4.68 achieves less than half of Goal(SAC) 122.72 +- 5.93).\n2. Besides, in the room arrangement, the rectangle-shape furniture objects do not satisfy the circle-shape assumption made by the decentralised planner ORCA. The authors also tried to implement a centralised planning algorithm for ball arrangement (i.e. RRT). However, though this algorithm can find a feasible solution in one minute when the object number is less than 3*3, it failed to search a motion plan in ten minutes when the number of objects got higher. This is also the well-known curse of the dimensionality problem of the centralised planner. These aspects cause unsatisfied performance for the goal-based approach.

Suppose a sample has been already used as a negative sample, and it converts later,\n      *how* to deal with this sample?\n      If the authors simply ignore it, then the authors have used the wrong label;\n      if the authors insert a duplicate with a positive label, then the data distribution $p(x)$\n      changes (negative samples appear once, but positive samples may appear twice),\n      and the label conflict still exists, how to repair it?\n   2. Another problem is *when* to use a sample.\n      Since the authors are not working with a static dataset passively,\n      the authors can choose the revealing time freely,\n      and this requires us to define a schedule explicitly for revealing the labels.\n\n3. **User actions play an intrinsically different role in learning with delayed feedback**:\n   In the setting of learning with heterogeneous feedback,\n   as the authors discussed in response to Reviewer fM2F Q4, user actions work more like\n   *complementary information to the conversion labels*.\n   In the setting of learning with delayed feedback,\n   the authors need to *rely on user actions to extract information related to conversions*\n   when ground-truth conversion labels have not been revealed yet.\n\nA: Q: What are the differences between GDFM and EHCF?\nA: 1. EHCF does not consider specific problems in learning with delayed feedback as\n   discussed in the previous question.\n\n2. As pointed out by Reviewer fM2F and fuKP, the proposed main contribution is providing a\n   novel probabilistic perspective to analyze the delayed feedback problem,\n   and come up with a practical method to measure the information carried by\n   user actions. These are novel points rooted in the delayed feedback problem and\n   are not considered by EHCF.\n\n3. The authors agree that in the proposed current implementation of GDFM,\n   $p(a|x)$ also relates with $p(y|x)$ linearly.\n   However, this formulation comes from the proposed probabilistic model naturally\n   with clear interpretability and establishes the base of the following analysis.\n   The linear mapping introduced by EHCF lacks such probabilistic insight.\n\n4. The training methods are different, which leads to different results:\n   GDFM learns $p(a|y)$ explicitly,\n   whereas the meaning of linear transformation learned by EHCF\n   is unclear.\n\nA: Q: Experimental comparison between GDFM and heterogeneous feedback methods such as EHCF.\nA: As analyzed in the previous questions,\nwe can not compare GDFM with EHCF directly since EHCF does not support duplicated samples and\nchanging labels in the delayed feedback setting.\n\nThe authors agree that using trainable linear layers to capture relationships between user actions\nis an applicable idea in the delayed feedback setting with user actions.\nSo the authors implemented an architecture equipped with the Transfer-based Multi-Behavior Prediction layer\nas proposed in the EHCF paper\nand used the same duplicating and revealing strategy as in GDFM to conduct a reasonable comparison.\nThe authors denote this as the \"Linear relation\" method.\nThe authors evaluate the performance on the Taobao dataset.\n\nThe performance of the Linear relation method is:\n\nAUC: 63.4±0.9%, PR-AUC: 50.1±1.5%, NLL: -470±4.6%\n\nand GDFM is:\n\nAUC: 79.4±0.5%, PR-AUC: 80.7±0.9%, NLL: 49.6±3.1%\n\nThe results support that utilizing the relationship between user actions and conversions with a proper sampling strategy\nwill improve performance on AUC and PR-AUC.\nHowever, since the Linear relation method does not consider label changing,\nthe NLL is significantly worse. And the AUC and PR-AUC metrics of GDFM are also better than EHCF based method.\n\nThe experimental results and discussion about some related heterogeneous feedback methods [1, 2, 3]\nare added to the paper.

There have been a very limited number of numerical algorithms whose upper bounds on convergence are proven to be tight under restrictive conditions. For example, paper [A6] derives a tight upper bound of the gradient descent method with exact line search for unconstrained optimization when the objective function is $L$-smooth and $\\mu$-strongly convex. Paper [A7] derives an almost tight upper bound, by comparing the upper bound with the lower bound, for nonparametric regression using stochastic gradient descent when there is no observation noise, the estimation error diminishes almost surely, and the feature variables are uniformly\nbounded. To the best of the proposed knowledge, the authors have not found any paper showing the upper bound on prediction error under Byzantine attacks is tight through mathematical proofs or simulations. Please refer to [A1]-[A5] and the references therein. In fact, the upper bound provides insights on the potential factors that affect prediction errors, e.g., the number of Byzantine agents. This helps us to analyze the effects on the prediction error convergence Byzantine agents cause. \nReferences\n[A1] P. Blanchard, E. M. El Mhamdi, R. Guerraoui, and J.

The proposed results point to the tantalizing possibility that the same accuracy may be obtainable with exponentially fewer resources (data + compute), if data is carefully curated. The question is absolutely correct that neural scaling laws guide investments into different accuracy improvement strategies.

One of the contributions of CodeTransformer is showing the benefits of training multilingual models across different languages. The code parser Semantic facilitates their multi-language setting by providing _unified_ ASTs for different languages. So as you see, after training across different languages, the performance of CodeTransformer outperforms the monolingual one. \n\nIn this work, the authors mainly focus on studying the effectiveness of integrating different kinds of path encoding methods and the relationship between them, instead of multilingual training. So the authors mainly compare the result of monolingual CodeTransformer with the proposed model. But it does not mean that the proposed models cannot benefit from the multilingual training. \n\nFor training across different languages, a _unified_ multilingual parser is the key. But unfortunately, the parser the authors used Tree-Sitter can not provide _unified_ syntax trees for different languages yet. As a result, the node type vocab for different languages is also different (for the Go language, the nodes vocab size is 94, and 105 for Ruby, Js and Python). For example, the node type 'statement_block' of JS is not present in Python language. So for the multilingual training, one possible solution is to modify the TreeSitter's parse syntax to provide _unified_ syntax trees for different languages. Another possible solution is to adopt a large node vocab, which is the union of different languages' node vocab. After such a process, the authors believe that the proposed model can also benefit from multilingual training. Training multilingual models is indeed an interesting topic, and perhaps the authors will investigate it further in future."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, the authors find it is not enough to improve the performance of BCQ-MA and CQL-MA by fine-tuning hyperparameters.\nIt is not surprising that BCQ-MA and CQL-MA have poor performance in the multi-agent experimental results. In the supplementary experimental results, current offline methods are still not good enough in handling the extrapolation error in complex single-agent offline tasks, such as antmaze-medium/large and adroit-human. Based on the analysis in Section 3 and the toy example in Figure 2 in the paper, the extrapolation error is quickly accumulated with the growth of the number of agents. Multi-agent offline tasks are less tolerant of extrapolation errors than single-agent offline tasks. Therefore, most single-agent offline RL methods cannot be extended in multi-agent offline tasks.\nIn contrast, ICQ alleviates the extrapolation error by a simple yet efficient method instead of training a separate network as BCQ or using additional regularization terms, such as CQL or BRAC.  As evidence, ICQ achieves high performance in complex single-agent offline tasks such as antmaze and adroit.

Thus, improved performance on OOD tasks.

The proposed additional supervision from clustering on another modality does not come with such high quality pairs, i.e., the authors do not have hard negatives for these modalities. The mismatch in the form of losses in text and image/audio may partly explain why the improvements in supervised setting are smaller. In fact, such high quality pairs for text are also only available in English.  The authors could not evaluate supervised CSE in other languages, because the NLI dataset is not available in other languages. In fact, this is one limitation of supervised CSE, i.e., it relies on a high quality labeled dataset for training which is often not available in other languages. Since the authors think that the main problem is the lack of high quality positive / hard-negative pairs in other modalities the authors don’t believe that more unlabeled training data can further improve the supervised setting. Also, the authors find that the training of SimCSE and the proposed VisualCSE usually converge (based on validation loss) in a few thousands steps, meaning that having more unlabeled training data does not improve the performance of the proposed current framework.

In the proposed work, the authors investigate image captioning models with two different encoders, respectively based on the structure of Resnet-152 and VGG-16. The results show that the image captioning models with Resnet encoder are slightly more vulnerable to the proposed attacks, where the attack success rate on the target model with Resnet encoder is 0.4%(in average) higher than the attack success rate on the target model with VGG encoder. The reason is perhaps, as the network structure of Resnet is deeper than VGG, the Resnet encoder may extract more representative features and thus benefits from the membership inference attack. However, the scope of the proposed current research focuses on the empirical study of membership inference attacks on multimodal models, but it is definitely worthy of diving into this area in the future.\n\nReferences:\n[r3] Investigating on Incorporating Pretrained and Learnable Speaker Representations for Multi-Speaker Multi-Style Text-to-Speech.

The authors analyze these two aspects separately:\n\nFirst of all, for the generation of index pairs, the authors implement it by constraining the output position based on the index mask. Specifically, the authors only need to pass the index mask into the kernel function as a parameter and use a rule to determine whether the original index pair satisfies the constraints of the index mask. The authors believe that this part does not account for a high proportion of the overall network inference time, as shown in the table in A2, the impact on CUDA threads thus can be ignored.\n\nSecondly, For GEMM, the implementation of spconv is calculated along the spatial dimensions of the kernel, eg. kernel size: 3x3x3.

However, because the number of true relevant features is in general unknown beforehand (as Reviewer #1 notes), the predominant approach recent papers have considered is to output the top-K important features, for varying values for K. For example, in attribution methods such as Grad and IG, the authors could take the top-K features with the highest attribution scores. And K is usually set to varying values so that the authors generate relevant feature set explanations of different sizes. Similarly, in the proposed method, the authors allow users to set the value of K such that the proposed explanation could identify the top-K most important features to the prediction. In the proposed experiments, the authors vary the value of K such that the proposed explanations provide sets of relevant features of sizes 5%, 10%, ..., 50% of the total number of features. Then, for each of these relevant sets with differing sizes, the authors could apply the proposed evaluation criteria to evaluate their quality, which yields a single evaluation curve shown in Figure 1. \n\nSuch evaluation curves measure the quality of an explanation by considering differing sizes of relevant features, and the AUC then reflects the overall quality of the explanation. In the case where users have no knowledge about the number of relevant features, the proposed work thus suggests the use of AUC of the evaluation curve, which as the reviewer notes is indeed more than adequate as an evaluation. But to also provide a rationale for evaluations of differing values of K: it provides the quality of the relevant sets along multiple points on the evaluation curve, instead of a single numerical summary. And in some special use cases, the users might indeed be interested in a pre-defined size of relevant set, e.g. top-20% relevant features. But as the reviewer suggests, in the proposed work, the authors do recommend the use of AUC, which the authors also use to compare across different explanations, in addition to plotting the whole evaluation curves to illustrate the performances of different explanations at various sizes of relevant set."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In other words, the definition of “context” is not restricted to the conventional meaning of “context” such as season and fashion trends that the authors use only as examples.

Therefore, **the question really is if the authors can truly discover the user preference shift or shifts of other latent confounding factors hidden in the data**, which the challenging part.

InfoGraph has two advantages when compared with these methods. First, InfoGraph learns representations directly from data instead of utilizing hand-crafted procedures (i.e. Weisfeiler-Lehman relabelling algorithm in graph2vec and anonymous random walk in [2]). Second, InfoGraph has a clear objective that can be easily combined with other objective. For example, InfoGraph*, the semi-supervised method that the authors proposed.

In fact, the authors found a small but measurable improvement on ObjectNav in the Matterport3D dataset. However, the proposed intuition is aligned with the question -- at some point there must be a negative effect. To test this, the authors performed a toy experiment where the authors artificially reduced the simulation speed of all environments except one by ~30x. Thus, nearly-all experience is collected from this one fast environment. As expected, the result is overfitting -- the agent performs well in that one single (fast) environment but does poorly in the vast majority of (slow) environments. The resulting Pick policy achieves 93% success when sampling training environments with the same frequency as training, but only 55% success when sampling the same environments uniformly. Ultimately, this pathological behavior is pointing to the underlying speed vs experience diversity trade-off. The authors can mitigate overfitting by forcing a minimum amount of experience from each environment. This would come at the cost of reduced throughput. The authors should note that AsyncOnRL is subject to the same trade-off. It too collects more experience from slower to simulate environments.

In Proposition 5, the authors require that $D\\_{TV}(\\hat{\\mu}(\\cdot|s)||\\mu(\\cdot|s))\\le \\epsilon<\\frac{1}{2}$. Such assumption generally requires that the empirical density distribution fits well the true behavior policy. The authors want to note here that $D\\_{TV}(\\hat{\\mu}(\\cdot|s)||\\mu(\\cdot|s))\\in[0,1]$. Then ensuring that $D\\_{TV}(\\hat{\\mu}(\\cdot|s)||\\mu(\\cdot|s))<\\frac{1}{2}$ can be satisfied for most situations as CVAE fits the behavior policy in many datasets well in practice. Under such assumption and based on the theoretical results in Proposition 5, the pseudo target value has a chance to exceed $\\max\\_{a\\in\\rm{support}(\\mu)}Q(s,a)$. However, that does not indicate that bad OOD actions will be executed in practice. The reasons lie in two aspects: (1) the theoretical bound is an *upper* bound, and it does not necessarily mean that the pseudo target value will exceed $\\max\\_{a\\in\\rm{support}(\\mu)}Q(s,a)$; (2) if the learned behavior policy (CVAE) fits well the true behavior policy, most of the sampled actions from the density model (CVAE) will be in-distribution that are well-trained, i.e., they will not exceed $\\max\\_{a\\in\\rm{support}(\\mu)}Q(s,a)$. If OOD actions are involved in the actions sampled from the CVAE, its negative impact can be *averaged* and mitigated by these in-distribution actions. Therefore, the pseudo target values for the OOD actions sampled from the trained policy will not be overwhelmed by the overestimated values. Empirically, the authors find MCQ exhibits good performance on non-expert datasets and behaves fairly well on expert datasets, which the authors believe can ease this concern to some extent."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Adding a geometry branch is one instantiation of the proposed idea, which can provide explicit supervision on the generator to improve the quality of the underlying geometry. In Sec. 4.4, the authors would like to show that the proposed framework can also be used to improve the multi-view consistency, by simply incorporating a *consistency branch*. The authors add this extension to show the generalizability of the proposed framework.\n\nThe newly introduced consistency branch, together with the novel view synthesis task, does not necessarily improve the synthesis quality. Instead, it helps improve the property of multi-view consistency. Concretely, although the generative neural radiance field is primarily designed for 3D-aware image synthesis, recent works (like StyleNeRF [9] and VolumeGAN [34]) introduce CNN on top of NeRF to allow high-resolution image synthesis. The CNN is performed in the 2D space, and hence fail to guarantee the 3D property. Under such a case, the proposed consistency branch could help improve the cross-view consistency, as shown in Tab. 3 in the submission."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

First, the original, true demographic cues that reside in the original image; second, the false demographic cues that reside in the trigger in the border/patch. The two cues can coexist and the false cues do not need to overlie the true cues. The key is that the false cues need to be strong enough so that the neural model, when presented with the two potentially conflicting cues, will go for the false one. This is entirely possible because the neural model has not seen the fairness trigger before so it cannot learn to ignore it. This intuition is also supported by the proposed empirical analysis in Table 3, where the trigger is found to contain strong demographic cues. The authors will move Table 3 to the main paper and improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis sections."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Could you explain more about the results?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors agree that RL-S2V has a larger action space, which means the optimal solution it can achieve is as good or better than the one the proposed method can find. However, both methods are not guaranteed to always find the optimal solution in the given action space. The authors list some potential reasons to explain why ReWatt can outperform RL-S2V as follows:\n1) When performing an adding/deleting edge action in RL-S2V, it chooses two nodes sequentially. Then it decides to add an edge between two nodes if they are not connected, otherwise, the edge between them is removed. Since most graphs are very sparse, the RL-S2V algorithm is, by design, biased to adding an edge. On the other hand, ReWatt removes an edge and then add another edge. The adding/deleting edge operations are more balanced. \n2) The reward design in ReWatt is different from RL-S2V. In RL-S2V, a non-zero reward is only given at the end of an attacking session. Specifically, at the end of an attacking session, a positive reward of $1$ is given if the attack succeeded, otherwise a negative reward $-1$ is given. All the intermediate steps get $0$ reward. In ReWatt, the reward is given after each action. A positive reward is given once an action leads to a successful attack. A negative reward is penalized to take each action if it does not directly lead to a successful attack, which encourages the attacker to make as few actions as possible. Furthermore, the authors also proposed an adaptive negative reward design, which determines the value of the negative reward according to the size of each graph. In fact, the design of this adaptive negative reward has shown to be very effective and important to the ReWatt framework. As shown in Table 1, ReWatt-n (which is a variant of ReWatt without the adaptive negative reward design) performs much worse than ReWatt. Specifically, if the authors apply ReWatt-n in the same setting of RL-S2V (with fixed actions), its performance is not as good as RL-S2V in REDDIT-MULTI-12K and REDDIT-MULTI-5K datasets. The performance of ReWatt-n on REDDIT-MULTI-12K is [11.26%; 14.7%; 18.02] while RL-S2V achieves [9.46; 18.5% 21.1%]. On the REDDIT-MULTI-5K, the performance of ReWatt-n is [4.49%; 5.62%; 6.74%] while RL-S2V archives [4.49%; 16.9%; 18.0%].

Consider for example a simulated landscape generated using a fractal algorithm (or even a \"classical\" fractal such as the Mandelbrot set), and then images of it taken from different perspectives. \"Fractalness\" of the object does not necessarily imply that the resulting perspectives would be well-suited to self-similarity-based methods such as Neural Collages. In particular, Neural Collages exploit self-similarity at a tile level (in pixel space!), which can be present even when the object in the image is not fractal. The authors strongly agree that there are many stimulating questions at the intersection of self-similarity methods and deep learning, certainly far too many to answer in a single paper.

Meanwhile, different attention heads may contain totally different regional information. It’s extremely difficult to learn the weights spatial convolution and hard to optimize. In contrast, the low-rank constraints on the generated filters provide smoothed candidates of these high-frequency attention maps. Then it’s much easier for the spatially-variant coefficient estimator to learn the combination weights.

As the authors mentioned in lines 30-32, the spatial-agnostic problem ([Su et al.(2019)] and [Wu et al(2018)]) is that the kernel sharing scheme lacks the ability to adapt kernels to diverse feature patterns with respect to different spatial positions. To speak specifically, consider the gradient of a convolution layer during the training process, different descend directions are applied to minimize the loss at each position. If the kernel is spatially shared, the loss gradients at each position will be globally pooled to train the kernel, leading to the sub-optimal kernel learning that the global gradient could be zero while the local gradient is non-zero. Equivariant property has no correlation to the spatial-agnostic problem, but one of their common architecture, G-CNN, suffers from this problem. Here, for G-CNN, the ‘spatial’ is not in a narrow sense in the 2-dimension plane, it refers to the group space. Although bringing in more kernels can alleviate the problem to some extent, it largely increases the number of parameters and memory footprints and is inefficient, especially for G-CNN. \n\nOne of the solutions is to make the kernel position-specific, as discussed in [20,36,37], which can alleviate the unshareable descend direction issue and take advantage of gradients at each position.\nOur implementation of $E^4$layer avoids the spatial-agnostic issue by designing a kernel generating function $K_{\\hat{g"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Why combing Eqn. 4 and Eqn. 5 in Eqn. 6 is reasonable? It lacks the motivation", "reference_answer": "A: (1) As shown in [A], the estimated QR distribution is a mixture of parametric and intrinsic uncertainties. As learning progresses the parametric uncertainty vanishes and the intrinsic uncertainty stays. Therefore, this left truncated variance exploration bonus will tend to be biased towards intrinsic variation, which hurts performance. To suppress intrinsic uncertainty, the authors need a decaying schedule. From the classical QR theory [B], it is known that parametric uncertainty decays at the following rate:\n$$\nc_t=c\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log t}{t}}\n$$\nWhere c is a constant factor. So the authors use c_tj as the decaying schedule.\n\n(2) The left truncated variance defined in Eqn.4 enhances the agent's exploration ability and makes the agent optimistic in the face of uncertainty, and the risk-seeking exploration bonus defined in Eqn.6 encourages agents to select actions that have higher potential payoffs. The ablation study in Sec 5.5 shows that these two objectives are equally important for agents to achieve coordination strategies efficiently.\n\nReferences:\n\n[A]Mavrin, Borislav, et al. \"Distributional reinforcement learning for efficient exploration.\" International conference on machine learning.

The authors use clustering to learn the similarity/dissimilarity relationship between samples and super-classes in order to learn discriminative information so that the model keeps separability.\n\nUnfortunately, as immutability and separability are only the insights the authors propose, there is no standard way of measuring them.

What kinds of operations does it count? Are they MultiMerge and Neighborhood Primitives? Why do the authors use work rather than running time in Th 1.1? What is the running time of the algorithm?", "reference_answer": "A: Since the running time of parallel algorithms depends on the number of processors, the authors use the work-depth model to describe the theoretical complexity of their algorithms; the work and depth bounds are agnostic to the number of processors, and the running time for a given number of processors can be derived from the work and depth. The work-depth model is a popularly-used model for describing shared-memory parallel algorithms (“Introduction to Algorithms (3. ed.)”. Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. 2009; “Introduction to Parallel Algorithms”. Jaja. 1992). The work-depth model is also the primary parallel model used in a variety of recent papers on shared-memory multicore algorithms for graph problems, e.g., [20, 22], pointset clustering [46], as well as tree-based algorithms [21, 24] (as well as “PAM: Parallel Augmented Maps”. Sun et al. PPoPP’2018). Deriving good bounds for the work and depth of an algorithm also implies good bounds for the problem in a variety of classical models for parallelism such as different PRAM variants due to efficient simulation results ([8] presents an overview).\n\nThe work is the total number of primitive operations (neither multimerge nor neighborhood primitives; by primitive, the authors mean basic computations, such as value assignment or arithmetic). The work is also equivalent to the running time of a parallel algorithm given only a single processor. The depth is the longest series of sequential dependencies, and can be colloquially thought of as the running time on an ideal computer with infinite available processors.\n\nGiven a work bound of $W$ and a depth bound of $D$, Brent’s law states that the running time using $P$ processors is upper-bounded by $O(D + W / P)$. Thus, it is desirable to reduce both the work and depth in designing a parallel algorithm. The running time of the proposed algorithm given $P$ processors is $O(\\log^4(n) + m * \\mathsf{polylog}(n) / P)$.\n[8] Guy E Blelloch, Jeremy T Fineman, Yan Gu, and Yihan Sun.

For example AIR does not seem to be affected by any of the changes and does not perform well, whereas MONet benefits from almost all changes (except YCB-S+C+U – why?)", "reference_answer": "A: This is a great question. The authors have an additional section (Section 4.5) in the main paper to analyze the sensitivity of different models on different dataset factors. In particular,\n- **AIR**:  As a factor based model, AIR has a strong spatial-locality bias. Despite its poor segmentation performance across all datasets, there is a notable improvement when inter-object shape variation is ablated from real-world datasets (U / T+U / S+C+U / S+C+T+U). More convincingly, even when all other three factors are ablated (S+C+T), it can be hardly improved. These observations show that object shape variation is a significant factor for AIR.\n- **MONet**:  MONet is more sensitive to color-related factors than shape-related factors. The ablations of object color gradient and inter-object color similarity significantly improve its performance, while ablations of object shape concavity and inter-object shape variation make little differences. For the two color-related factors, the scene-level one is more important than the object-level factor. From this, the authors can see that MONet has a strong dependency on color. Similar colors tend to be grouped together while different colors are separated apart. Furthermore, the ablation on object color gradient alleviates over-segmentation whereas the ablation on inter-object color similarity alleviates under-segmentation. The authors conjecture that under-segmentation can be a more severe issue for MONet on real-world datasets, leading to a larger sensitivity on the scene-level color factor.\n- **IODINE**: IODINE also has a heavy dependency on both object- and scene-level color-related factors. However, different from MONet, the ablation on object color gradient brings better performance than inter-object color similarity. The authors speculate it is because the regularization on shape latent alleviates under-segmentation by bias towards more regular shapes. In this way, over-segmentation is the key issue, making the inter-object color similarity a dominant factor.\n- **SlotAtt**: The ablations on all four factors increase the performance of SlotAtt at different levels, among which object- and scene-level color-related factors are more significant. The authors conjecture that it is because the feature embeddings used by Slot Attention module are learnt from both pixel colors and coordinates, which contributes to its sensitivity to both shape and color factors.\n\nOverall, the authors hope that these findings could be beneficial for future studies in the community.

As shown in the table below, the proposed method achieves significantly better performance than all other methods and real data, especially when the authors distill only one image per class. The authors observe that methods like DSA and DM that work reasonably well for coarse-grained image classification tasks fail to outperform the real data baseline on the fined-grained classification task. This is because DSA and DM learn the distilled data independently and fail to capture the similarity among different classes. In contrast, the proposed method works well as the authors take into account the class similarity by considering all classes together and learning the label. The learned label also plays an important role at test time. Similar to the teacher label in knowledge distillation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531), the proposed distilled label is soft and not only contains knowledge for the most likely class but also contains “dark knowledge” like class similarity for all other classes. As a result, training a model from scratch on the proposed distilled data achieves much better performance than the previous methods that do not learn the label.\n\nTable: Test accuracies of models trained on the distilled data from scratch on CUB-200-2011 (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/), a fine-grained image classification dataset.

The latter line of work studies how to poison an RL agent by perturbing its state or reward signals, but the attack method used does not have to be RL-based. In the FL setting, it is nearly impossible for the attackers to collect enough samples to sufficiently train a complex attack policy (e.g., using a high dimensional neural network), which is typically needed to break a strong defense. Previous online-RL works either ignore sample efficiency or focus on attacks in the testing stage (which is the proposed method's attack execution stage), where they assume that the attack policy is already sufficiently trained. In contrast, the authors of this paper solve this problem by simulating environments using the learned distribution, where they can generate sufficient samples, and parallelly run multiple environments (no communication overhead in simulation) when the FL is ongoing. Further, existing RL poisoning attacks have mainly focused on attacking a single RL agent by an external agent rather than an insider attack in a distributed learning environment as the authors consider. Also, given that the two lines of research consider very different settings, it is difficult to compare them quantitatively. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Therefore, it requires custom hardware with large SRAM to fit the entire key sequence, which is not yet practical for GPUs.\n\nFLAT’s speedup is measured with a hardware simulator. On the other hand, FlashAttention yields wallclock speedup and memory saving on commodity GPUs by operating on blocks (requiring relatively much smaller SRAM compared to custom accelerators).

For the shallow ones, the advantage of the proposed Diverse Message Passing comes from its capability in modeling the diverse homophily rates of the attributes. Here, the authors give more elaborations on the advantage of generating F groups of 2-components partitions for the semi-supervised learning task in DEEP GNNs.\nFor (semi-)supervised learning task, to make the learned model robust, the embeddings of data should be diverse to represent the structure of each class. For example, if $x_1^c, x_2^c, …, x_{n_c}^c$ are the training samples from class $c$, $x_j^c$’s should be different to others, to better represent the structure of class $c$. For the extreme case where all the $x_j^c$'s are identical, training with t samples is as bad as that with one sample. Since the embeddings generated from F groups of 2-components partitions are more diverse than that from a single F-components partition in the semi-supervised learning task, the authors design the proposed DMP by forming F groups of 2-components partitions.\nThe diversities of the above two cases are analyzed as follows.\n\nTheorem 1 in [R1] proves that, as the number of graph convolutional layers increases, the node embeddings will converge to a few vectors, which is the over-smoothing issue. These vectors are fully determined by the indication vectors of the connected components. Specifically, given a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with $k$ connected components $\\\\{C_i\\\\}_{i=1}^{k}$, the indication vector for the $i$-th component is denoted by $\\mathbf{1}^{(i)}\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$. This vector indicates whether a vertex is in the component $C_i$, i.e., i.e.,$\\mathbf{1}^{(i)}_j=1$ if  $v_j \\in C_i$; $\\mathbf{1}^{(i)}_j=0$ if $v_j \\not\\in C_i$.\n\n According to Theorem 4 in the proposed work, the Uniform Message Passing actually partitions the graph $\\mathcal{G}$ into F connected components. Then, the embeddings in Uniform Message Passing will converge to $\\mathbf{1}^{(i)}\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$, where only one element is 1 and other elements are 0, for $i=1,…,F$, i.e., the over-smoothing issue appears. \n \nTheorem 5 indicates that the proposed Diverse Message Passing generates F groups of 2-components partitions, which is equivalent to generating $2^F$ candidate components. If the 2-components partition of the j-th group for node $i$ is represented by a scalar $t_j^{(i)} = \\\\{0,1\\\\}$, the F groups of 2-components partitions for node $I$ can be represented by $\\mathbf{t}^{(i)} = \\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$. Note that different from $\\mathbf{1}^{(i)}\\in\\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$ in Uniform Message Passing, where only one element is 1 and the other elements are 0, each element in $\\mathbf{t}^{(i)} = \\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$ can be either 1 or 0. Then, $\\mathbf{t}^{(i)} = \\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$ may possess $2^F$ different values. Therefore, the embeddings in the proposed Diverse Message Passing converge to $\\mathbf{t}^{(i)} = \\\\{0,1\\\\}^k$. \n\nIn summary, the numbers of converged vectors in F groups of 2-components partitions and one F-components partition are $2^F$ and $F$, respectively. Thus, the embeddings obtained from F groups of 2-components partitions are more diverse than those from one F-components partition. Therefore, generating F groups of 2-components partitions is better than generating one F-components partition on semi-supervised learning.\n\n[R1] Qimai Li, Zhichao Han, Xiao-Ming Wu: Deeper Insights Into Graph Convolutional Networks for Semi-Supervised Learning.

And the authors roughly annotate the positions of cars (red) and pedestrians (yellow). The authors observe that most of the foreground points are preserved. For the background areas, points that fall in vertical structures, such as light, poles, and trees, are also preserved  as they tend to be hard negatives, and easily confused with foreground objects. These points require a deep neural network with a certain capability to process in order to recognize them as background.  In contrast, background points in flat structures such as road points are largely removed because they are easily identifiable redundant points.\n**Why foreground points with high feature magnitude?**  To gain more insights into why high feature magnitude corresponds to the above patterns, the authors conjecture that this is caused by the training objective in 3D object detection. When training a 3D object detection model, the focal loss is adopted as default in 3D object detection. When the authors look closer at the focal loss, it will incur a loss on positive samples and hard negatives while easy negatives are removed from the loss. Thus, this will generate gradients in the direction that can incur an update of features for areas with positive samples and hard negatives. This can eventually make a difference in their feature magnitudes in comparison with areas for easy negatives which are less frequently considered in the optimization objective."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The authors are glad to see more research interests and results on this problem and have descent respect to every try in this topic.\n\nDifferences: The proposed approach is different from these two concurrent papers, in that the Laplace noise the authors add has non-zero mean. This allows us to simply publish the constructed synthetic graph, upon which standard APSP computation leads to the desired error level. In contrast, in both [Ghazi et al. 2022] and [Chen et al. 2022], the noise is centered and one has to use some specifically designed calculation (optimization) to obtain the estimated distances. In other words, only the estimated distances, but not the graph itself, can be published. Typically, releasing the graph (ours) is more difficult than releasing the distances only (theirs).\n\nTheory: the proposed work and the two concurrent papers all implemented a similar idea of constructing shortcuts in some way, and proved the $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{n})$ error in the most general case. Ghazi et al. obtained a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/6})$, and Chen et al. showed an error slightly better than $O(n^{1/2})$ under the constraint of bounded weights.

The log-barrier [R1] uses is over individual arm probabilities, whereas the authors of this paper crucially use a variant of the log-barrier taken over the marginal clique probabilities.  This is in order to avoid (additive) dependence of $O(N)$ in the regret, which is suboptimal in the feedback graph setting ([R1] indeed suffers such an additive term). However, replacing this term with a Tsallis entropy would introduce an additive term scaling like in the regret (specifically in the penalty term), which is suboptimal for the graph feedback setting and which the authors tried to avoid."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Theoretically/mathematically (not only quantitatively), why does VER perform better than AsyncOnRL?", "reference_answer": "A: There are two key differences between VER and AsyncOnRL that explain why VER performs better. The first is shown in Fig 1 -- AsyncOnRL overlaps experience collection with learning while VER does not. This explains why VER is more sample efficient. Due to this overlap, AsyncOnRL must learn with data collected from an older policy (L43-45). This effect is often referred to as policy lag and the data is often referred to as near-policy data. The on-policy objective used to optimize the policy is only well-defined for on-policy data and thus it follows that using near-policy data will reduce the efficiency of this objective. Methods like V-trace attempt to resolve this but they are only approximations. The authors are unaware of any work that proves that AsyncOnRL has reduced sample efficiency (and doing so is beyond the scope of the proposed work), but this has been observed in prior work, Liu et al 2020, and observed in the proposed work (Fig 4). The second difference is how multi-GPU scaling is achieved. VER uses the decentralized distributed method proposed in Wijmans et al 2020. In this method each GPU both collects experience and updates the model (see Sec 2.3 for more details). In AsyncOnRL framework the authors compare against, multi-GPU scaling is achieved by using additional GPUs for experience collection while learning is still performed on 1 GPU (explained in L291-L301). This difference explains why VER has better throughput on multiple GPUs. More formally, the maximum throughput of AsyncOnRL is the maximum number of samples per second the single GPU used for learning can process. This is a constant. As the authors increase the number of GPUs used for experience collection, the authors will approach and then reach this, but the authors cannot exceed it. The multi-GPU throughput of VER is nGPUs * ScalingFactor * VERSingleGPUThroughput.\nScalingFactor and VERSingleGPUThroughput are constants, but nGPUs is not (it will have a maximum in practice, but theoretically it can be any non-negative value). Thus there must be a value of nGPUs such that nGPUs * ScalingFactor * VERSingleGPUThroughput > MaxAsyncOnRLThroughput"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Before the authors answer this question, let us recall the basics of analysis of DPSGD. In DPSGD, the authors add noise to clipped per-sample gradients and hence every iterate of DPSGD is private. In other words, after each iteration t of DPSGD, model weights W_t can be assumed to be public information. Now, in iteration t+1, gradients of samples are computed with respect to W_t, and hence privacy only depends on gradients belonging to the samples in a single batch. This is crucial for applying amplification by subsampling theorems in privacy analysis. \nNow consider a framework where the teacher models are trained using SGD on the dataset D and the student models are trained with DPSGD while minimizing the Equation 1 on dataset D. Such an algorithm does not output a differentially private compressed student model. This is due to the distillation loss term H(y_true, P_S) in Equation 1. Here, P_S is a function of the entire dataset as the teacher was not trained with DP. Therefore,  gradients of samples are now functions of entire dataset D, which forbids us from applying subsampling theorems in privacy analysis. The proposed solution to circumvent this was to make P_S DP as well by training the teacher model with DP on dataset D. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Computing relational pooling means that one needs to impose each possible order of the nodes in the subgraph, encode the subgraph under each possible order and then pool the encoded representations into a single subgraph representation. This way is much more computationally complicated than the proposed simple GNN model. The bound the authors get for the complexity is also a special case of what is appeared in a preprint [3]. I do not clearly see how [4] and [5] are relevant as [4] is to perform subgraph matching instead of entire graph representation learning. [5] can perform entire graph representation learning. However, the hierarchical pooling proposed by [5] is not to encode the subgraph around each node but to group nodes into several clusters and perform pooling for each cluster. \n\nNevertheless, the authors would like to empirically compare the proposed method with [1] and [5] that also target entire graph representation learning. The authors compare [1] using the common datasets used between [1] and the proposed work, i.e., ogbg-molhiv and QM9.

The authors search the subgraph height $h$ in {2,3,4,5} for Nested GraphSAGE and search the number of layers in {2,3,4,5} for DiffPool. The results are as follows.\n\n|                  | D&D               | MUTAG             | PROTEINS          | PTC_MR            | ENZYMES           |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| DiffPool         | **0.778 ± 0.039** | 0.830 ± 0.055     | **0.742 ± 0.045** | 0.529 ± 0.055     | **0.338 ± 0.062** |\n| Nested GraphSAGE | 0.774 ± 0.042     | **0.839 ± 0.107** | **0.742 ± 0.037** | **0.570 ± 0.059** | 0.307 ± 0.063     |\n\nThe authors find that their Nested GraphSAGE has competitive performance to DiffPool.

As the network is end-to-end optimized for the object detection task, the additional gradient will not interfere with the original gradient but instead try to make areas that are important for detection have a larger magnitude.\n\n(2) Necessity of the multiplication operation: the authors do further investigation on whether this multiplication is necessary. The authors observe that it only brings marginal performance gains as shown in Table below. This further confirms that without any additional guidance, the magnitude of features from a detection network is sufficient to serve as a good criterion for deciding important vs unimportant regions. This strengthens the proposed initial claim and echoes the proposed motivation of using magnitude as a selection criterion.\n\n| Method (KITTI)           | Easy  | Moderate | Hard  |\n| ------------------------ | ----- | -------- | ----- |\n| SPSS-Conv                | 89.22 | 84.36    | 78.83 |\n| SPSS-Conv (not multiply) | 89.02 | 84.13    | 78.81 |\n\n| Method (nuScenes)        | mAP   | NDS   |\n| ------------------------ | ----- | ----- |\n| SPSS-Conv                | 58.48 | 66.11 |\n| SPSS-Conv (not multiply) | 58.27 | 66.01 |"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Did you try implementing the version of the method that regularizes only OOD actions?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors would like to argue that many offline RL algorithms have this issue, e.g., BCQ [1], MOPO [2], etc. The practical implementation of BCQ involves convex combination of double critics (in target value calculation), and perturbation noise in actions. The error estimator in MOPO is set to be the maximum standard deviation of the learned models in the ensemble, which also lacks theoretical guarantee and diverges from its theory. The involvement of neural networks makes it hard for us to implement MCQ that follows its original theoretical form. As for MCQ, if the behavior policy $\\mu(\\cdot|s)$ is previously known, then the authors can implement MCQ that exactly follows its theory (i.e., Definition 1). Unfortunately, the authors often do not have prior knowledge about the data-collecting policy $\\mu(\\cdot|s)$. The authors then resort to fitting an empirical distribution $\\hat{\\mu}(\\cdot|s)$, and follows Definition 2 (practical MCB operator). However, the authors cannot directly apply the practical MCB operator in deep RL since it is challenging to evaluate whether an action is OOD (and the authors cannot say that the action that does not exist in the batch is OOD, especially for continuous action space). The authors therefore simply assign pseudo target values for all actions sampled from the trained policy such that OOD actions are properly trained. The actions sampled from the trained policy may have less probability of being OOD with the increment of training steps, while the risk of being OOD still exists. To mitigate such potential threats, the authors need to regularize actions sampled from the trained policy. In the proposed experiments, the authors assign large weighting coefficient $\\lambda$ to in-distribution samples, which ensures sufficient training on in-distribution transitions. Empirical success of MCQ on non-expert datasets show that MCQ is less likely to over-penalize the optimal actions.\n[1] S. Fujimoto, D. Meger, and D. Precup.

Since batch-norm re-calibration can be considered as the necessary correction to ensure a fair evaluation, the authors don’t retrain the last logits layer or upscale the signal in the original paper. In this response, the authors also provide some experimental results after retraining the last logits (with 10/100 epochs) and upscaling the signal (following [5]), as shown in Table r1. On the one hand, retraining the last logits can further improve the subnetworks after CT, but subnetworks from (ST + retrain the last logits) still perform much better than that from (CT + retrain the last logits). Besides, the authors show that retraining the last logits with different epochs has no effect on the relative ranking of subnetworks, and the performance of retraining 10 epochs is similar to that of retraining 100 epochs. On the other hand, the authors can see that upscaling the signal has little impact on the performance, the main reason is that batch-norm re-calibration can correct the signal automatically.\n\n[4] Jiahui Yu and Thomas S Huang.

The authors will clarify that while GOSDT is designed to *eliminate almost all of* the search space (to produce one tree), TreeFARMS is designed to find and *store* the whole Rashomon set. The authors modified GOSDT to produce a dependency graph that contains the entire Rashomon set, rather than to simply guarantee that it contains the optimal tree.

Please explain.", "reference_answer": "A: When not all variables of interest can be measured, DAGs between these observed variables are not sufficient to represent the observed distribution, since latent variables may introduce confounding effects between the observed variables. In these cases, it is very common to model the observed variables through MAGs and it comes with many desirable properties (see e.g., Richardson et al. 2002, ‘Ancestral Graph Markov Models’).  The example pointed out in the question is correct. Using single vertex (atomic) hard interventions, the authors can differentiate MAGs from DAGs for some specific graphs. However, it is not generally true for any pair of MAG and a DAG. Consider the DAG $G=$ { $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C, A \\leftarrow L1 \\rightarrow C, A \\leftarrow L2 \\rightarrow B, B \\leftarrow L3 \\rightarrow C $} with latents $L1$, $L2,$ and $L3$; and a MAG $M=$ { $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C, A \\rightarrow C $}. The authors can observe that both these causal graphs are Markov equivalent. However, unlike the example mentioned by the reviewer, the authors cannot distinguish these two graphs using any single vertex interventions. Such examples can be constructed for distinguishing two DAGs as well (Fig. 4). As described in the paper, for practical reasons, the proposed choice of interventions is restricted to atomic interventions (non-atomic interventions are just too hard to implement in practice). However, the authors note that the proposed choice of using MAGs is not based on the choice of the interventional setup (atomic or not), but rather the fact that the MAGs are an attractive way to model the causal structure in presence of latents. The proposed setup does benefit from the fact the learning of MAGs is compatible with atomic interventions. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The main result of these works is: \"By treating node features H as signal X (corresponding to $x(u,t)$ in heat equation Eq.2) on the graph, solving the heat equation with Euler scheme yields the formulation of a GNN layer.\" In other words, the GNN can be seen as the discretizations of the continuous diffusion process described by the heat equation. Correspondingly in Eq.7, the left equation is a general GNN layer (discretized diffusion process), and the right equation is directly derived from Eq.2 (continuous diffusion process). Moreover, different definitions of Laplace-Beltrami operator $\\Delta$ yield different GNNs (such as SGC and linear GAT).

However, it is not due to a NaN in the gradient vector, as the authors adopt a NaN detection technique in the experiments, and the attacker will take a less ambitious action if a NaN is encountered (see Appendix D.1 Attack execution setting). As they observed in the experiments, the RL attack can quickly lead the server to a ‘bad’ model, while each gradient it sends is still legal. This again shows the advantage of the RL attack over myopic attacks, i.e., finding a shortest path (multiple steps into the future) towards a target model instead of finding a one-step gradient (after aggregation) that points to a bad model.

As a short summary, BCO learns an inverse dynamics model to infer actions from sequences of expert observations and then carries out behaviour cloning. In contrast VMAIL learns a forward dynamics model to generate data for policy training using an adversarial approach.

It is not a good criterion, since a large portion of the background is still left, while the ball is already incomplete in (b). The separation using the rigidity map in Figure 9 (d) is much better.

The authors will incorporate these arguments into the final revision (which has more space) for clarification.\n1. Gradient bias intrinsically inherits the non-decomposability of the contrastive loss due to the negative samples in the denominator. In principle, since contrastive learning defines a set of transformation functions, meaning one data sample in theory should be associated with an infinite number of negative samples by taking different transformations of other data. This is defined as the generalization loss. Using minibatch optimization on a finite training data defines the empirical loss. One difference of contrastive learning compared to standard supervised learning is that the gradient, when simply doing empirical risk optimization with minibatches, is a biased version of the true gradient. Thus, simply using empirical loss optimization with bias gradients to approximate the generalization loss optimization might not be a good idea, which can lead to potential sub-optimal solutions.\n2. A: The authors demonstrate the performance gap with extensive experiments, all suggesting performance improvements when correcting the gradient bias with the proposed algorithm. Remarkably, the proposed solution to this issue only needs minimal modifications to the original contrastive learning, but can lead to consistent performance improvement under different settings (from small scale to large scale problems, and from single modal data to multi-modal data), with little computation overhead (empirically around 10% in the proposed experiments compared to standard contrastive learning).\n3. A: In the cases of small minibatches, since the sum of negative similarity scores will typically be more noisy than that with larger minibatches, it is expected that the gradient bias will be a little more dominating. However, even if using large minibatches, gradient bias still exists. This can be seen from the performance gap between the proposed method and the standard contrastive learning. Please see the gaps of large batchsizes in Table 1 and 2. Even though the gaps tend to become smaller, they are still significant enough compared to the standard contrastive learning (in the large models and data setting such as the ImageNet experiments in Table 2, the authors believe an improvement around 0.5 is considered significant in the community, e.g., please see Table 2 in the UniCL paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03610.pdf).\n4. A: The authors agree increasing batch sizes can mitigate the issue to some extent. However, this is not considered to be principled and economic for this problem. The authors believe one goal of research is to develop better and more efficient solutions for large problems, and the authors do not think it is wise to stop exploring other efficient solvers for a problem if one only can solve it in a resource-heavy way (such as using large minibatches). Increasing batch size indicates the need to use expensive and higher-performance computing machines. For example, MoCo-v3 uses the most powerful TPU servers for large batch-size experiments, which is unaffordable to most researchers. The proposed method tries to address the problem in a more principled way by correcting the gradient bias, which the authors believe can be further improved with acceleration techniques such as variance reduction from standard stochastic optimization literatures (which the authors leave as interesting further work).\n5. A: The authors believe, in the near future, the scale of data will increase much faster than that of the computational power. In other words, the largest batch setting achieved today is still considered small given an extremely large dataset, especially in the multi-modal setting. So investigating scaling up small minibatch training is still an important problem.\n6. A: Furthermore, the proposed work provides one potential explanation for the common question of “why contrastive learning needs much larger batch sizes compared to standard supervised learning?”. The authors can explain it from the perspective of gradient bias, i.e., smaller batch sizes could induce more gradient bias thus it is more difficult to control the quality of stochastic gradients, leading to worse solutions.\n7. A: Using other tricks such as feature normalization can mitigate the problem to a certain degree. However, the bias could still exist in theory. Moreover, the proposed method is orthogonal to these tricks so can be combined to get better solutions."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In MARL, the authors claim that the aleatoric uncertainty, i.e., the intrinsic stochasticity in the environment, is caused by other learning agents' exploration and policy updating. Distributional RL, which aims to learn the distribution of returns instead of the mean value only, has been suggested as a way of measuring aleatoric uncertainty[A]. So the authors adopted distributional RL to capture the aleatoric uncertainty in general-sum games.\n\nFurthermore, the action whose value distribution has a longer upper tail means that taking this action may have higher potential payoffs. However, its mean value may be lower than other actions since its distribution also has a longer lower tail, which means higher risk. So agents with the expected RL method will not select this action. The authors proposed to utilize the risk-seeking exploration bonus to encourage agents to pay more attention to actions whose distribution has a longer upper tail. So agents with the proposed GRSP method will be less likely to defect to others since defects bring lower future returns, and more likely to coordinate with each other although coordination has a bit of risk. \n\nIn a word, the risk-seeking approach will encourage agents to explore regions that have higher potential future returns and be more tolerant of the risk.\n\nthe authors hope the authors answered your questions. \n\n[A] Nikolov, Nikolay, et al. \"Information-directed exploration for deep reinforcement learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.07544 (2018)."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Note that this is a new multi-state matrix game with partial observability. Agent 1 has only partial observations and thus cannot fully distinguish state 1 or state 2 from its local observations (i.e. $o_{1}(s_{1})$ = $o_{1}(s_{2})$). This is a simplified scenario of a more common case in POMDP where one agent may partially observe state transitions.

For general federated minimax optimization problem, local SGDA is, to the best of the proposed knowledge, the only communication-efficient algorithm that allows multiple local updates with rigorous convergence guarantees. However, as Proposition 1 states, even under the ideal case with deterministic full gradients, local SGDA still cannot reach linear convergence to the exact solution, which is the main motivation of the proposed algorithm. In this sense, FedGDA-GT is the first communication-efficient algorithm that guarantees correct fixed points with linear rate, which indicates a faster convergence rather than sublinear rate is expected. The case involving gradient noise and stochastic analysis of FedGDA-GT is very interesting and valuable, which will be the proposed future work. Here, the authors could provide the proposed insight on the convergence result when considering gradient noise. Intuitively, due to the gradient noise, the authors could expect that FedGDA-GT might finally converge linearly to some error neighborhood characterized by the variance of the gradient noise if constant stepsizes are applied. However, if exact convergence is required, diminishing stepsizes might be necessary in order to cancel the randomness caused by the gradient noise."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

There are, however, a couple of reasons why they didn’t prioritize prompt tuning in their experiments:\n* Despite the innocuous-looking number of parameters that get updated during prompt tuning, even a single prompt can be tuned to match the performance of full-model finetuning on nontrivial tasks. (see Figure 3 in Lester et. al. (2021)) In addition, sometimes heavy regularization in form of l2 regularization and dropout is needed to prevent overfitting to the training set when one uses prompt tuning. These all suggest that the behaviour of prompt tuning might be qualitatively more similar to fine-tuning than prompting by hand.\n* Initialization plays a very important role in prompt tuning (see the discussion in Section 7 in Lester et. al.), indicating that the optimization landscape is highly non-convex. In the context of prompt tuning for algorithmic tasks, one needs to be careful while picking prompt initializations.\n* Dyer et. al. (2021) has shown that scale goes a very long way towards fixing catastrophic forgetting. The authors find in their experiments that even 50b models show practically the same generalization trends as 1000x smaller models.\n* The authors did do a bit of exploratory automated prompt tuning (in token space) for the chain-of-thought parity task by varying the randomizable elements in the prompt. While the authors did see a spread in performance, no single prompt significantly overperformed the others. The authors didn’t use the highly tuned prompt in our results in order to avoid overclaiming.\n\nReferences:\nLester et al. 2021 The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning.\nRamasesh, Vinay Venkatesh, Aitor Lewkowycz, and Ethan Dyer. \"Effect of scale on catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.\" In International Conference on Learning Representations. 2021.\n"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Linformer utilizes linear projections to project keys and values from the original sequence length to a smaller length, i.e., compressing the information. The drawback of Linformer is that the input sequence length should be assumed and hence it cannot be used in the generation task. The proposed method can be in general regarded as a sparse attention. Each token directly attends to a subset of tokens so the complexity can be decreased. However, unlike previous sparse attention works, the proposed method decides the subset according to the data content, i.e., the structure-related bars that are important for the generation for the current bar. Besides, instead of simply dropping other contextual information, the proposed method propose to keep it via the novel bar summary mechanism. The mechanism between the two models are totally different, and the proposed method can achieve the best results compared to the strong baselines."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Is there anything substantial to the derivation of DPM-Solver than directly using the variation-of-constants?", "reference_answer": "A: The variation-of-constants is a classical idea for solving the semi-linear ODE, so it is natural to combine it with diffusion ODEs which have a semi-linear structure. However, to the best of the proposed knowledge, the connection between the variation-of-constants and DPMs has not been revealed in the prior literature, so the combination of each other is also the proposed contribution. Further, compared to directly using the variation-of-constants, the authors emphasize that the change-of-variable for $\\lambda$ is highly nontrivial and can bring much more insights. The authors discuss the difference between directly using the variation-of-constants and the proposed DPM-Solver below to demonstrate that **the change-of-variable for $\\lambda$ is also critical and is the proposed novel contribution**.\n\nFor the original diffusion ODE, the exact solution can be formulated by the variation of constants:\n$$ x_t = e^{\\int_s^t f(\\tau)\\mathrm{d}\\tau}x_s + \\int_s^t \\left(e^{\\int_\\tau^t f(r)\\mathrm{d} r}\\frac{g^2(\\tau)}{2\\sigma_\\tau} \\epsilon_\\theta(x_\\tau,\\tau)\\right)\\mathrm{d}\\tau. $$\nIf the authors directly approximate the above integral, the authors need to discretize and approximate the coefficients related to $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ (i.e., the noise schedule). Such computation is complicated and may involve other discretization errors. Instead, the authors propose the following equivalent but much simpler formulation:\n$$ x_t = \\frac{\\alpha_t}{\\alpha_s}x_s - \\alpha_t \\int_{\\lambda_s}^{\\lambda_t} e^{-\\lambda} \\hat\\epsilon_\\theta(\\hat x_\\lambda,\\lambda)\\mathrm{d}\\lambda. $$\nWhat the authors want to emphasize is that, the above integral is **invariant to the noise schedule** between $\\lambda_s$ and $\\lambda_t$ because the integrand contains no functions about $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ and only related to $\\epsilon_\\theta$. Such formulation can unify the sampling of diffusion models for different types of noise schedules. Therefore, the proposed DPM-Solver is also invariant to the noise schedule and is a general solver for all types of diffusion models. The authors have updated Appendix A in the revision to discuss more such invariance properties. Therefore, DPM-Solver is a customized solver for DPMs, and its derivation is more than directly using the variation-of-constants.

The authors suspect that combining some techniques of this paper and the proof of, say, Du et al.'18, can lead to results for narrow-nets that cover ReLU. \n\n[R1] Li, Dawei, Tian Ding, and Ruoyu Sun. \"On the benefit of width for neural networks: Disappearance of bad basins.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.11039 (2018).\n[R2] Du, Simon S., et al. \"Gradient descent provably optimizes over-parameterized neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02054 (2018)."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

More specifically, the authors tested a subset of the instances to find that pseudocosts were exactly zero in 99.8% of the cases.

First, the authors would like to kindly highlight that the authors utilize $\\epsilon = 0.05$ instead of 0.005, which is incorrectly indicated in the question., \n2. Additionally, the authors argue that $\\epsilon = 0.05$ is already a very large perturbation. As Table 1 shows, the proposed attack with $\\epsilon = 0.05$ reduces all the clean trained models’ robust accuracy to 0 or near 0. The authors have also tested that even with $\\epsilon = 0.02$, the adversary can still reduce all the models’ robust accuracy to less than 5%. On the other hand, the perturbed point clouds with $\\epsilon = 0.05$ are at the edge of correct human predictions of objects. As the authors are not allowed to insert links, the authors kindly refer the reviewer to Figure 9 in [1], which also indicates the same conclusion. Numerically, $\\epsilon = 0.05$ out of the range [-1,1] is also similar to the commonly used  $\\epsilon = \\frac{8}{255}$ in 2D adversarial training [2].  \n3. The authors use the experimental guidelines in [1] because it is the only existing work that leverages adversarial training analysis in 3D point clouds. \nThe authors follow the reviewer’s suggestions to evaluate the proposed adversarially trained model on more attacks including PGD attacks with $\\epsilon = 0.02/0.04/0.06$ and C&W attack. \nThe results of PDG attack with different  $\\epsilon = 0.02/0.04/0.06$  as shown as follows. \n\n|                |     | ModelNet40  |                 | |       ScanObjectNN         |      | |   ModelNet10     |      |\n|    :----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |:----:   |\n|           RA(%)           | PointNet   | DGCNN     | PCT       | PointNet     | DGCNN     | PCT       | PointNet   | DGCNN     | PCT       |\n| AT Baseline ($\\epsilon=0.02$)    | 63.2±0.33  | 80.9±0.22 | 78.8±0.15 | 43.6±0.31    | 54.9±0.55 | 54.1±0.33 | 91.9±0.21  | 93.3±0.19 | 92.1±0.13 |\n| Best Finetuned ($\\epsilon=0.02$) | 76.0±0.19  | 84.3±0.19 | 79.4±0.17 | 47.4±0.23    | 62.0±0.51 | 56.1±0.49 | 92.1±0.25  | 96.2±0.26 | 94.6±0.16 |\n| AT Baseline ($\\epsilon=0.04$)    | 46.2±0.3   | 70.9±0.3  | 61.3±0.11 | 28.5±0.19    | 39.6±0.45 | 35.1±0.21 | 84.5±0.36  | 91.0±0.37 | 86.2±0.29 |\n| Best Finetuned ($\\epsilon=0.04$) | 61.1±0.15  | 76.7±0.25 | 62.9±0.13 | 31.8±0.4     | 48.9±0.6  | 37.4±0.39 | 85.2±0.26  | 92.9±0.44 | 88.4±0.41 |\n| AT Baseline ($\\epsilon=0.06$)    | 25.1±0.51  | 48.9±0.69 | 37.2±0.33 | 17.8±0.15    | 25.6±0.33 | 19.1±0.4  | 74.1±0.12  | 84.2±0.55 | 77.0±0.29 |\n| Best Finetuned ($\\epsilon=0.06$) | 43.2±0.41  | 54.1±0.75 | 39.6±0.2  | 19.3±0.23    | 33.1±0.65 | 20.5±0.37 | 75.0±0.2   | 86.4±0.48 | 77.6±0.47 |\nFrom this table, the authors observe that the proposed model could achieve non-trivial robustness among different epsilons (even with  $\\epsilon > 0.05$), and it is expected that the adversarially trained models perform better with $\\epsilon < 0.05$. The proposed model trained with self-supervised learning also achieves consistently stronger robustness than the AT and ST baselines. It further verifies the significance of self-supervised learning for 3D point cloud robustness. \nIn the following table, the authors show the robustness of the proposed best fine-tuned model against target C&W attack. For each test sample, the authors randomly select a class as a target. The authors also compare it with two baselines, including standard training (ST) baseline and adversarial training (AT) baseline.

The distilled data is the product of the optimization procedure, and it converges to a similar point whether it is initialized from the real image or random noise. As you can see in the videos, the distilled data is far away from its initialization. Intuitively, the distill data can be considered the \"principle component\" of a dataset. Instead of selecting or copying the exact images from the dataset, the proposed method synthesizes the images that best reflect the most representative pattern in the original dataset. \n\nAnother evidence that \"learning\" is happening is that a pair of distilled images and labels are highly correlated. Suppose you interpolate the label value between two different classes and only learn the image. You can see the learned image interpolates between the two classes as well, which suggests the proposed method tries to synthesize the best image to reflect its label."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In fact, the proposed SHIFT method can be easily modified to receive stream data. \nIn the SHIFT method, the key logic is to fine-tune the local estimators, each of which is obtained by averaging the hashed samples of cluster (see Appendix A). The fine-tuning procedure and the entry-wise robust estimates only take a few sweeps of the local estimators, which is computationally cheap. When a new datapoint comes in, the local estimators can be updated incrementally due to its averaging structure. Specifically, when the hashed version of the $(n+1)$-th datapoint $X^{t,n+1}$ of cluster $t$ is received by the server,  the according local estimator can be updated as follows:\n$$\\check{\\mathbf{b}}^t\\\\;\\leftarrow\\\\;\\frac{n}{n+1}\\check{\\mathbf{b}}^t+\\frac{1}{n+1}\\mathrm{decode}(\\mathrm{hash}_\\text{encode}(X^{t,n+1}))$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{decode}$ and $\\mathrm{hash}_\\text{encode}$ indicate the hash-based encoding procedure and the decoding procedure respectively (see Appendix A for more details)\n\nIn this way, the server can keep the local estimators which can be updated in an online fashion, and output the fine-tuned estimators whenever needed."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, the central idea behind this work is to effectively sample from a low-dimensional potential energy surface. To that end, the authors assume that small variations in dihedral angles will lead to near-degenerate conformations with similar energy, which could be treated as similar conformations. Therefore, using discretized dihedral angle values could reduce the dimension of the entire modeling space, hence helping the proposed RMCF model to better capture a diverse set of low energy conformations from the reduced potential energy surface.\n- Notably, the discretization of 3D molecular fragment conformations introduced in the proposed work bears a resemblance to the proposed treatment on the dihedral angles, since the 3D fragment conformations are also continuous variables. The main purpose of the proposed discretized treatment is to restrict the dimension of the PES spanned by fragment conformations and inter-fragment dihedral angles to facilitate generating (meta)stable conformations through RMCF."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The reviewer is right that by randomly sampling the point cloud, even dropping 30% of the points will not have a major impact on the classification accuracy.

However, the proposed point dropping is conducted in an **adversarial** manner using the method proposed in [2]. The adversary tries to drop the most influential points with regard to the classification accuracy. [2] shows that with 200 dropped points, the remaining point cloud can even fool human perception. Therefore, the authors restrict the threat model to be capable of dropping 100 points to not affect human perception of the remaining point clouds.\n[1] Lang, Itai, Asaf Manor, and Shai Avidan. \"Samplenet: Differentiable point cloud sampling.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2020.\n[2] Zheng, Tianhang, et al. \"Pointcloud saliency maps.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2019."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Hoffman, “Sentry: Selective entropy optimization via committee consistency for unsupervised domain adaptation,” in Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 8558–8567, 2021.", "reference_answer": "A: PACMAC and SENTRY [B] both use selective self-training on reliable instances identified via predictive consistency, and that PACMAC makes use of in-domain self-supervised pretraining proposed in Shen et al. [A]. However, PACMAC differs from a combination of [A]+[B] in 2 important ways, which leads to improved performance:\ni) **PACMAC proposes a novel proxy task for identifying reliable target instances**: predictive consistency across partial image inputs generated via masking. By doing so, PACMAC approximately matches the design of its selection strategy to its SSL pretraining (MAE [E] and DINO [D], which learn to reconstruct / learn invariance to partial inputs respectively), in contrast to SENTRY, which measures consistency across random image augmentations.\nii) **PACMAC incorporates model knowledge in its selection strategy** by using attention-conditioning to focus on salient image regions, rather than random augmentations sampled from a manually pre-defined set.\nUnlike a naive combination of [A]+[B], PACMAC thus explicitly couples its SSL pretraining with its selection strategy, and further improves this selection by leveraging the Vision Transformer (ViT) attention mechanism. \nThe authors demonstrate that such coupling improves performance. First, they ablate PACMAC by replacing its selection strategy with SENTRY’s: they exactly match hyperparameters, and select target instances based on predictive consistency across 3 image augmentations, generated via RandAugment [C] with N=3 and M=2.0, and use majority voting. Shown below are target accuracies averaged over all 12 shifts in OfficeHome:\n\n|     | MAE | DINO |\n| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |\n| SENTRY selection    |  66.1   |   67.4     |\n| PACMAC selection    | **66.8**      |   **69.6**     |\n\nAs seen, PACMAC selection outperforms SENTRY selection in both cases: +0.7 (MAE init.) and +2.2 (DINO init.). They compare directly against a combination of Shen et al.[A]+ and SENTRY [B]: The authors note that the full SENTRY method uses additional diversity regularizers and entropy maximization losses. For a fair comparison, the authors add these losses to their method and call it PACMAC*. Shown below are target accuracies comparing [A]+[B] with PACMAC*, averaged across 12 OfficeHome shifts with a DINO initialization:\n\n|     | acc.(%) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Shen et al. [28] + SENTRY [9]    | 69.6       |\n| PACMAC*   | **70.6**    |\nIn this case as well, PACMAC* outperforms [A]+[B]. \nFinally, authors compare the effectiveness of SENTRY’s selection strategy against their on the Cl->Pr shift from OfficeHome. To do so, they measure reliability precision (how often is a target instance marked as reliable, actually correctly classified?), and reliability recall (what fraction of correctly classified target instances are selected via each method?), and compute the F1 score. Averaged across epochs, they observe the following (from the detailed plot in Sec 2.4 of supplementary):\n\n|     | avg. F1 score |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| SENTRY selection    |  84.0      |\n| PACMAC selection   |  **85.0**    |"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

It is actually common and valid that the authors tune parameters for specific datasets in real-world applications. The role of offline RL is leaned towards providing a pre-trained policy, which is fine-tuned with limited interactions with the environment. Under such a setting, hyperparameter tuning is feasible and necessary to guarantee a good pre-trained policy.

Intuitively, the authors want to make sure that for the latents that the authors use during generation, the authors should have already “seen” them during training (more precisely, the authors should have “seen” a “close enough” one with high probability). \n\nIn normalizing flows, the latent distribution accessed during training is the pushforward of the training set with the flow model (similar to regular VAE encoders). Theorem 2 states that this distribution can be quite different from the one used for sampling, even though the KL divergence between them is small enough. \n\nFrom another angle, the dimensions of the latents (3k) is very high compared to the amount of data samples the authors have (50k for CIFAR). So even when two distributions can be quite different (in terms of support space), it would be nearly impossible to tell them apart with just 50k samples. As a result, there are many latent variables that the authors use during generation, but have not been “seen” during training; analogous to adversarial examples, samples from these latents are not expected to have good sample quality.\n\nDiffusion models and GANs do not have the above problem, since the latent distribution used for training and generation are the same by construction (and not made \"close\" by optimization).

Most related works that study general-sum games assume their opponents have fixed policies, e.g., [B],[C],[D]. However, in the proposed work, the authors consider achieving coordination in multiple learning agents, which is a more general case. The authors have compared the proposed GRSP with [C] because it is the latest work. The problems studied in [A], [E], [F], and [G] are more related to ours. [A] proposed that agents can exchange their parameters and gradients with their opponents, which is a too strong assumption. The authors have compared the proposed GRSP with [A] LOLA in the rebuttal revision. The method proposed in [E] is too weak and can not achieve complete cooperation even in iterated stag hunt games. [F] and [G] belong to reward shaping methods, and the authors have compared GRSP with [F] in the appendix of the proposed work. The method proposed in [G] can not match their official codes, so the authors didn't compare GRSP with them.\n\nThe reason why the authors compare GRSP with IAC, MADDPG, and MAPPPO is that the assumptions of these methods are similar to ours, e.g., multiple learning agents, can not access opponent's rewards or parameters, and so on. However, MADDPG assumes access to the opponent's observations and actions to train a centralized critic, which is stronger than ours. But the proposed GRSP method still has better performance than theirs.

However, both methods are not guaranteed to always find the optimal solution in the given attack space. The authors list some potential reasons to explain why ReWatt can outperform RL-S2V as follows:\n1) When performing an adding/deleting edge action in RL-S2V, it chooses two nodes sequentially. Then it decides to add an edge between two nodes if they are not connected, otherwise, the edge between them is removed. Since most graphs are very sparse, the RL-S2V algorithm is, by design, biased to adding an edge. On the other hand, ReWatt removes an edge and then add another edge. The adding/deleting edge operations are more balanced. \n2) The reward design in ReWatt is different from RL-S2V. In RL-S2V, a non-zero reward is only given at the end of an attacking session. Specifically, at the end of an attacking session, a positive reward of $1$ is given if the attack succeeded, otherwise a negative reward $-1$ is given. All the intermediate steps get $0$ reward. In ReWatt, the reward is given after each action. A positive reward is given once an action leads to a successful attack. A negative reward is penalized to take each action if it does not directly lead to a successful attack, which encourages the attacker to make as few actions as possible. Furthermore, the authors also proposed an adaptive negative reward design, which determines the value of the negative reward according to the size of each graph. In fact, the design of this adaptive negative reward has shown to be very effective and important to the ReWatt framework. As shown in Table 1, ReWatt-n (which is a variant of ReWatt without adaptive negative reward design) performs much worse than ReWatt. Specifically, if the authors apply ReWatt-n in the same setting of RL-S2V (with fixed actions), its performance is not as good as RL-S2V in REDDIT-MULTI-12K and REDDIT-MULTI-5K datasets. The performance of ReWatt-n on REDDIT-MULTI-12K is [11.26%; 14.7%; 18.02] while RL-S2V achieves [9.46; 18.5% 21.1%]. On the REDDIT-MULTI-5K, the performance of ReWatt-n is [4.49%; 5.62%; 6.74%] while RL-S2V archives [4.49%; 16.9%; 18.0%]. Hence, the design of adaptive negative reward could be an important reason why ReWatt can perform better than RL-S2V.\nAlso, please note that RL-S2V cannot be implemented with actor-critic by simply replacing $p_{fir}*p_{thi}$ with $p(add/remove|e_t)$ in the framework of ReWatt. This is because the action of ReWatt is different from RL-S2V as described in 1). The edge $e_t$ chosen by ReWatt is an existing edge in the graph, therefore the authors can only delete it from the graph and can not add it to the graph. Hence, $p(add/remove|e_t)$ cannot be performed in practice. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Should we conclude \"bar summary\" is a more fundamental improvement compared to FC-attention?", "reference_answer": "A: Actually, \"Museformer w/o structure-related bar selection\" does not mean that it only has coarse-grained attention (bar summary). It means that the selected bars for fine-grained attention are the most recent 8 bars, instead of the structure-related bars elaborately selected by us, i.e., the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 16th, 24th, 32nd bar. Therefore, the differences between \"Museformer w/o structure-related bar selection\" and Music Transformer are: 1) the former only directly attends to the recent 8 bars, while the latter directly attends to all the previous tokens; 2) the former has coarse-grained attention (bar summary) while the latter does not. So, the comparison between them cannot result in the conclusion that bar summary gives a fundamental improvement. However, since the former is better than the latter, the authors can draw the concolusion that the combination of the fine- and coarse-grained attention is an effective replacement to the full attention. It also decreases the complexity and enables the model to encode long sequences. That the PPLs are so different and the PPL of Music Transformer increases drastically when the length increases is because, as the authors explained in the paper at the baseline introduction part, Music Transformer trained on chunked sequences cannot well predict the music tokens when the sequence length is larger than the chunk size, which indicates that directly applying the model trained on short sequences cannot well generalize to long sequences, and using a long-sequence model like Museformer to generate full-song music is a better choice."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The authors chose this approach because it only requires a room spec and an interior boundary, and doesn’t rely on an external database of floorplans to synthesize one. Thus, it is trivial to scale to include new room types (e.g., garages, balconies, stairways) and generate any type of home (e.g., from studio apartments to massive multi-family homes) just by modifying the room specs. [2, 3, 4] train a network to generate floorplans, but they do not support inputting any preferences about the number of rooms or the types of rooms in the scene. [5] supports passing in constraints, but it cannot generalize to new room types not seen during training, or to massive multi-family homes."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In the proposed implementation, the authors use linear interpolation and inverse property interpolation to impose the ordinality to the rank embeddings.

However, the authors would like to point out that this path counting technique cannot handle hypoactivation and interlayer correlation effects, whereas the proposed approach drastically simplifies the calculations required. On the other hand, [1] studies a finite depth and width correction based on a Taylor expansion approach, which allows them to compute in closed form first order corrections to training dynamics and generalization properties to the infinite-width regime. However, as this approach only studies a truncation of the Taylor series in terms of the depth-to-width ratio, this will not lead to a log-Gaussian distribution. While the proposed approach leads to a clean proof of the log-Gaussian limit, each of these techniques have their respective advantages and disadvantages, and should be considered for corresponding applications.\n\nThe reviewer also asked us to comment on [2], which was available after the NeurIPS submission deadline. Indeed [2] proved a similar log-Gaussian result to ours, however, the authors would like to point out that the authors decided to study a ResNet architecture that added skip connections after ReLU activations, which is known to perform worse in practice [5]. This subtle change is the root cause of hypoactivation and interlayer correlations, which [2] did not have to handle.

Specifically, if the model is a simple MLP, a trigger added to the input can be easily regarded as appending a bias term to the first layer. Nevertheless, similar conclusions can not be extended to transformers or convolutional layers as used in the NLP and CV domain in the proposed work, since their functions are more complex and cannot be represented by simple linear transformations. The reprogramming method still has a stronger representation power in this case. Moreover, please kindly be reminded that the motivation of fairness reprogramming is to resolve fairness tuning without having access to the model parameters.

For quick check, the authors conduct experiments on Pascal-5$^i$ with the 1-shot setting. The details for adapter and bias tuning are given below:\n\n- Adapter: Adapter is proposed in transformer-based models. When applying it into CNN-based backbone (ResNet), the authors make simple adjustments. The authors follow [C] to build the adapter structures and add them after the stages in the ResNet.\n- Bias Tuning: In the ResNet backbone, the convolution layers do not contain bias term. The bias terms that can be used for tuning is the ones in BN layers. The authors fine-tune the bias terms in all BN layers in this method.\n\nThe experimental results are given in the table below. It shows that **SVF outperform Adapter and Bias Tuning by large margins**. Moreover, the authors find that the introduction of Adapter will directly lead to over-fitting, while Bias Tuning reduces performance of the baseline model.\n\n| Method  | fine-tune method  | Fold-0  | Fold-1  | Fold-2  | Fold-3  | Mean  |\n| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |\n| baseline  |  Freeze Backbone | 65.60  | 70.28  | 64.12  | 60.27  | 65.07  |\n| baseline  |  SVF | 67.42  | 71.57  | 67.99  | 61.57  | **67.14**  |\n| baseline  |  Adapter | 18.41  | 20.21  | 26.62  | 17.62  | 20.71  |\n|  baseline |  Bias-Tuning |  61.62 |  70.10 | 64.80  | 55.19  | 62.93  |\n\nFor meta-learning and domain adaptation:\n- In the few-shot segmentation, meta-learning is applied in the segmentation head to learn the knowledge in support images but not in the backbone, posing challenges in directly comparing SVF with meta-learning methods.\n- In addition, domain adaptation is another research direction whose setting differs from the setting in few-shot segmentation."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Apart from the \"full-graph training\" case, there are two types of baselines: mini-batch sampling methods (GraphSAINT, VQ-GNN) and compression methods (graph coarsening). For sampling baselines, the authors have set the (average) subgraph size $b=0.1n$, and for compression methods, the authors have set the size of coarsened graph to be $0.1n$ too. Under this setup, the effective number of nodes fed to the model in sketch-GNN and the other baselines are all proportional to the sketch ratio $c/n$, no matter what sketch ratio the authors choose.

How to compare the step size η with the classic one in SGD? Is this choice of the learning rate critical to show the convergence?", "reference_answer": "A: There are two main motivations to consider restarting strategy for SGD. The first motivation is practical. Notice that the step-size schedule in the restarted SGD is essentially a popular step-decay (piecewise constant) strategy. Such technique is commonly used in practice and often outperforms the classical diminishing step-size schedule for SGD [Krizhevsky et al, 2012], [He et al, 2016]. Therefore, the authors believe it is important to provide solid theoretical foundations for such piecewise constant step-size strategy. \nThe second motivation comes from the analysis perspective. Notice that the restart strategy is crucial for obtaining $\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{2}{\\alpha}}$ sample complexity of PAGER. The authors provide discussion about why restarting is important and the intuition why SGD is not sufficient in Appendix C. Therefore, it becomes interesting to find out if restarts help to improve the sample complexity of SGD (as it is the case for variance reduced method). \nNotice that setting $T=1$, the proposed restarted SGD reduces to the standard SGD and the correspondence for the classical step-size becomes evident. Here, the authors analyze a more flexible step-size schedule, than a classic one (allowing to set arbitrary $T\\geq 1$). \nOverall, the authors did the proposed best to extensively analyze SGD from different angles (using minibatch, restarting, constant/varying step-sizes); however, the proposed conclusion is that at least following this type of analysis, the improvement over $\\varepsilon^{-\\frac{4-\\alpha}{\\alpha}}$ cannot be obtained. \n\nA.

The property a) is satisfied since the boundary of the intersected area matches some part of the pocket's boundary. The property b) is satisfied by overlapping molecules' shapes to avoid generating odd shapes, such as rectangle or triangle shapes which never occur in molecules. The results show that the overlapping method is relatively effective. Because the authors obtain the seed shape by overlapping drug-like molecules, the size of the seed shape is decided by the sampled molecules. For the initial position, the authors randomly sample one as long as the seed shape is outside the pocket shape. With such strategies, the authors can explore different regions of a given pocket, making the proposed method produce diverse molecules."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Unlike NLP, where the authors append the trigger to the input or embeddings, the model for tabular data is sensitive to input size. As the tabular data have a fixed input size, the authors can directly apply the **additive trigger** to the input data to keep the input dimension unchanged (i.e., adding a perturbation on the original input), just as the authors adopted in image domains (Figure 1). To verify the argument, the authors applied the proposed method to the tabular data and conducted additional experiments on the UCI Adult dataset with a two-layer MLP model, and the results are shown in this **[Figure](https://ibb.co/ssNyK7v)**. The results suggest that the proposed method could effectively improve model fairness for tabular data. The proposed method achieves comparable debiasing performance with the post-processing adversarial training method without modifying any model parameters."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For instance, they set the round number of SNL+ to be 1. \n\nNext, while this paper's problems are in a high-dimensional regime (e.g., $\\rm{dim}(\\mathbf{Z}) = 396,000$ for Lorenz 96), sequential neural likelihood estimation (SNL) in Papamakarios et al. [2019] does not scale to the high-dimensional setting, which is recognized as a limitation and future direction by the authors. The later work in Chen et al. [2020] SNL+ addresses this limitation by learning sufficient statistics (embeddings) of the data based on the infomax principle. Detailed empirical comparisons are shown in Tables 1 and 2 for SNL+.\n\nClosely related to Papamakarios et al. [2019], Lueckmann et al. [2019] tries to ``emulate'' the simulator likelihood and advocates the use of active learning to choose the simulations in the next round based on uncertainty in the posterior. This work is unable to compare with this method as Lueckmann et al.

SNPE-C gains an advantage against SNPE-A in that it has fewer restrictions regarding the form of prior and posterior by leveraging neural conditional density estimation [Papamakarios et al., 2017].

Secondly, the authors uniformly use a subgraph height=3 for all NGNNs without tuning it because GNNs do not have such a hyperparameter.

While adding captions is helpful, it is the combination of CLIP features with the language-guided attention framework and the Transformer architecture that leads to the overall best performance.

And it is possible to theoretically guarantee that the algorithm finds a spectrally optimized graph?", "reference_answer": "A: In the paper, the authors have included a description of the connection between the proposed algorithm and the optimization objective in (2). The original optimization objective function (9) includes three components: (a) log (det L) that corresponds to the sum of the Laplacian eigenvalues, (b) - \\alpha* X^T L X that corresponds to the smoothness of signals across the graph, and (c) - \\beta* |L|_0 that corresponds to graph sparsity. The proposed algorithm flow aims to iteratively identify and include the most spectrally-critical edges into the latest graph so that the first few Laplacian eigenvalues & eigenvectors can be most significantly perturbed with the minimum amount of edges. Since the inclusion of spectrally-critical edges will immediately improve distortion in the embedding space, the overall smoothness of graph signals will thus be significantly improved. In other words, the spectrally-critical edges will only impact the first few Laplacian eigenvalues and eigenvectors key to graph spectral properties, but not the largest few eigenvalues and eigenvectors-which will require adding much more edges to influence. It can be easily shown that including any additional edge into the graph will monotonically increase (a), but monotonically decrease (b) and (c). Specifically, when the spectra of the learned graph is not stable, adding spectrally-critical edges will dramatically increase  (a), while decreasing (b) and (c) at a much lower rate since the improved graph signal smoothness will only result in a slight change (increase) to  Tr(X^T L x). Consequently, the objective function in (2) will be effectively maximized by including only a small amount of spectrally-critical edges until the first few eigenvalues become sufficiently stable; when adding extra edges can no longer significantly perturb the first few eigenvalues, (b) and (c) will start to dominate the objective function value, indicating that the iterations should be terminated. The stopping condition can be controlled by properly setting an embedding distortion threshold for $\\eta $ or parameters $\\alpha$  and $\\beta$.

On the other hand, the dominant factor is still the $\\Delta$ term of Thm3."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

When proving a minimax lower bound, the authors care about quantities taking a form like $\\inf\\_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}\\max\\_{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}\\_d}\\mathrm{Measure}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}},\\mathbf{p})$ where $\\mathbf{p}$ is an unknown parameter lying in domain $\\mathcal{P}\\_d$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}$ can be arbitrary estimator (algorithm). Sometimes explicitly identifying the worst value $\\mathbf{p}^{worst}$ that maximizes the inner maximization can be hard, *i.e.,* $\\inf\\_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}\\mathrm{Measure}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}},\\mathbf{p}^{worst})=\\inf\\_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}\\max\\_{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}\\_d}\\mathrm{Measure}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}},\\mathbf{p})$. Therefore, a standard  technique in statistical decision theory is to find a surrogate distribution $D$ over the domain $\\mathcal{P}\\_d$ for the unknown parameter $\\mathbf{p}$. The distribution for the parameter is also called a **prior** in statistics.\nSince the authors naturally have \n$$\\inf\\_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}\\max\\_{\\mathbf{p}\\in\\mathcal{P}\\_d}\\mathrm{Measure}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}},\\mathbf{p})\\geq \\inf\\_{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}\\max\\_{\\mathrm{prior}\\\\,D,\\\\;\\mathbf{p}\\sim D}\\mathrm{Measure}(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}},\\mathbf{p}),$$\none can lower bound the original minimax quantity by explicitly identifying a worst **prior** for parameter $\\mathbf{p}$ instead of a single worst value.\n\nBack to the proposed work, the authors have multiple local parameters $\\\\{\\mathbf{p}^t:t\\in[T]\\\\}$ to be estimated. In the $s/2$-sparse case, the authors will construct a corresponding prior $D^t$ for each parameter $\\mathbf{p}^t$. Here \"independent priors\" means that $D^1,\\dots,D^T$ are independent distributions. This intuitively reflects that there is no knowledge towards the relation between the local parameters $\\\\{\\mathbf{p}^t:t\\in[T]\\\\}$ before looking the samples.\n\nthe authors hope the above explanation can help answer the reviewer's question.

Museformer exceeds the baseline models on both objective and subjective evaluation. However, as you may see, the ratings of short-term and long-term structures for all the models are relatively low. In recent days, the authors have further looked into the Maestro dataset to analyze the reasons, and observed that the dataset is relatively low-quality and is lack of music structures that prevail in most music: 1) The size of the dataset is small (only 1700+ songs), which is insufficient for training deep learning models. 2) What is more important is that, according to the dataset introduction [here](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro), the MIDIs are direct performance recordings rather than calibrated standard sheet music. Since human performers usually do not strictly follow their sheets plus different performers may have different performance styles like rubato, the note onsets and durations can drastically shift, which makes the structures much more complex to be accurately modeled. The authors display at [here](https://museformer.github.io/rebuttal#maestro_analysis)  a screenshot of a MIDI sample and the similarity distribution of the dataset to demonstrate the proposed claim.

The improvements are still significant when using only 1\\% features in base classes on Meta-dataset with 1\\% storage space (only 0.98M).\n\n| Selection Ratio| Latency| mini-test| CUB| Fungi| Omini| Sign| QDraw| Flower| DTD|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| baseline| 298| $64.63$| $47.75$| $42.36$| $77.28 $| $53.50$ | $51.60$| $70.33$| $50.47$         \n|TCPR| + 11| $68.06$ | $51.87$ | $44.38$ | $78.51 $ | $54.83$ | $54.62$ | $72.55$ | $52.50$ |\n| TCPR(p=1\\%)    | +4| $67.79$| $51.55$| $44.29$| $78.18$| $54.03$| $53.62$| $71.82$| $52.69$|\n\nThe authors also want to emphasize that the proposed TCPR still achieves better performance on most test sets except mini-test and coco if k<100, as shown in Figure 7.  In summary, the computational cost of identifying k-neighbors of support samples is small and can be further reduced with a large margin of improvement over baseline methods.

The Gaussian curvature can be defined by the coefficients of the first fundamental form and the coefficients of the second fundamental form.

Namely, in real-time settings, the authors only poison data during the accumulative phase. If the authors ask the ratio of poisoned data points that are fed into the model, the formula should be $$\\frac{\\textrm{Per-batch poisoning ratio}\\times\\textrm{Accumulative epochs}}{\\textrm{Burin-in epochs}+\\textrm{Accumulative epochs}}\\textrm{.}$$\nSo even if the authors use $100\\\\%$ per-batch poisoning ratio during the accumulative phase, the ratio of poisoned data points fed into the model is only $100\\\\% \\times 2 / (40 + 2)\\approx 4.76\\\\%$ in the proposed settings. In contrast, if the authors poison $10\\\\%$ data in an offline dataset, then the expected ratio of poisoned data points fed into the model is also $10\\\\%$.\nNevertheless, keeping a high poisoning ratio during the accumulative phase could still be challenging in practice. To this end, the authors constrain the poisoning operations to be imperceptible (e.g., less than $8/255$ under $\\ell_\\infty$-norm), while some previous works allow arbitrary modification on the poisoned data. Besides, the proposed ablation studies in Table 2 also show that the proposed method is still effective even if the authors use a $10\\\\%$ per-batch poisoning ratio.\nAs to the case of federated learning, the authors propose a simple trick of recovered offset in Eq. (14), such that the authors can only manipulate one client to achieve any poisoned aggregated gradient. Namely, if the authors want to feed the model with a poisoned aggregated gradient ${\\color{blue}\\mathcal{A}}(G)$, and the aggregated clean gradients of other clients is $G'$, then the authors can manipulate a single client to contribute a gradient of ${\\color{blue}\\mathcal{A}}(G)-G'$, such that the total gradient is ${\\color{blue}\\mathcal{A}}(G)-G'+G'={\\color{blue}\\mathcal{A}}(G)$."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

To elaborate: although both classes of methods can be expressed as modeling $p(y|x,\\mathcal{D})$, CARD assumes such $(x,y)$ comes from the same data-generating mechanism as the set $\\mathcal{D}$, while NP assumes $(x,y)$ to be not from the same distribution as $\\mathcal{D}$. While CARD fits in the traditional supervised learning setting for in-distribution generalization, NP is specifically suited for few-shot learning scenarios, where a good model would capture enough pattern from previously seen datasets so that it can generalize well with very limited samples from the new dataset. Furthermore, both classes of models are capable of generating stochastic output, where CARD aims to capture aleatoric uncertainty that’s intrinsic to the data (thus cannot be reduced), while NP can express epistemic uncertainty as it proposes more diverse functional forms at regions where data is sparse (and such uncertainty would reduce when more data is given). In terms of the conditioning of $\\mathcal{D}$, the information of $\\mathcal{D}$ is amortized into the network $\\epsilon_{\\theta}$ for CARD, while it is included as an explicit representation in the network that outputs the distribution parameters for $p(y|x)$. It’s also worth pointing out that CARD does not assume any parametric distributional form for  $p(y|x, \\mathcal{D})$, while NP assumes a Gaussian distribution, and designs the objective function with such assumption.\n\nThe concept and comparison between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is more thoroughly discussed in [What Uncertainties Do The authors Need in Bayesian Deep Learning for Computer Vision?](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2017/file/2650d6089a6d640c5e85b2b88265dc2b-Paper.pdf) (2017) by Kendall and Gal, in which the authors quote, “Out-of-data examples, which can be identified with epistemic uncertainty, cannot be identified with aleatoric uncertainty alone.” The authors acknowledge that modeling OOD uncertainty is an important topic for regression tasks; however, the authors design the proposed model to focus on modeling aleatoric uncertainty in this paper.

The proposed primal-dual algorithm can be generalized to handle the infinite horizon setting by changing the subroutine for solving the unconstrained Markov game. To explain, first, the strong duality result can be straightforwardly generalized to the infinite-horizon setting, as the structure of the linear program is highly similar to that in the finite horizon setting. Then, in each primal update, the authors will need to solve an infinite-horizon unconstrained Markov game similar to the one shown in eq.(8). To do this, the authors can extend the existing V-learning algorithm for finite-horizon Markov games to the infinite horizon setting. Specifically, the existing V-learning algorithm is based on the finite-horizon Bellman equation, and the authors can adapt it to the discounted infinite-horizon Bellman equation, leading to the update rule $V^{(m)}(s_t)\\leftarrow (1-\\alpha_t)V^{(m)}(s_t)+\\alpha_t\\big(r_t^{(m)}+\\gamma V^{(m)}(s_{t+1})+\\beta_t\\big)$ (for agent $m$ at time $t$), where $\\beta_t>0$ is the bonus to promote optimism and exploration. \nThe convergence analysis of this primal-dual algorithm in the infinite-horizon setting follows the same logic as that of the proposed current analysis. The only difference is that the authors will need to develop finite-time convergence analysis for the modified V-learning subroutine, which the authors think can be inspired from the existing analysis in the finite-horizon setting."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

(2) architecture, the authors use energy-based model as base model and compose them to recognize novel hierarchical concepts, while [1] uses a Recursive Cortical Network (RCN), and [2] first needs to construct a Generative Shape Model for the fonts, then   parse factor graph by solving an optimization problem. The proposed ZeroC requires much less engineering effort to adapt to the specific dataset, and can learn more general concepts and relations as explained in the answer to question 1. (3) Learning: the authors use contrastive divergence for learning the EBMs, while RCN in [1] is learned in a bottom-up way, and [2] uses a maximum-margin structured output learning paradigm.\nThis model in principle is able to solve CAPTCHAs.

In this paper, it is shown that the authors can reduce the depth to only polylogarithmic, while keeping the work near-linear.\nThe main contribution of [r1] in the area of approximate HAC is sending an important *conceptual* message. That is, the paper observes that considering $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate HAC leads to an algorithm with near-linear running time. However, the algorithm in [r1] itself is based on a relatively straightforward observation that it suffices to update cluster-related information only when the cluster increases its size by a $(1+\\epsilon)$ factor.

However, the authors do not think the proposed method has the desired adaptivity the authors hope. There are two ad hoc solutions.

However, since the target dataset is kept the same, it is expected to see that there will be a huge information overlap among the two sets of distilled images. Therefore, the improvement provided by the second distillation will be very marginal. The other solution is to consider the previously distilled images when the authors distill another set of images by including them in the meta-gradient computation. This way, the authors can minimize the information overlap between the two distillation phases. However, the authors do not expect to see any training efficiency improvement compared to distilling 15 images per class from scratch because the size of Gram matrices are the same, and it is likely to take a similar amount of steps for all synthetic images to converge.

Specifically it is usually measured or determined by certain criteria e.g. a scaffold pattern corresponds to a certain environment whose underlying data distribution can differ from another environment with its own distribution. To be more concrete, the authors provide some example protocols in peer works as follows:\n\n1. WILDS [1] provides a curated benchmark of 10 datasets reflecting a diverse range of distribution shifts, with a protocol saying: \"each environment corresponds to a distribution $P_{e}$ over data points which are similar in some way, e.g. molecules with the same scaffold\". In other words, for example, molecules with different scaffolds can be regarded as being sampled from different distributions.\n2. OGB [2], a widely-used benchmark in molecule representation learning, also assumes molecules with different scaffolds are from different distributions. It should be mentioned that the official default train/val/test data split in OGB is based on scaffold splitting, which can provide a more realistic estimate of model performance in prospective experimental settings. Thus, for the four datasets BACE, BBBP, SIDER and HIV from OGB, the authors directly use the default data split in the proposed experiments. \n3. DrugOOD [3], which is a newly realeased benchmark for out-of-distribution molecule representation learning, provides two extra splitting strategies, assay and size. The original paper clearly states that molecules in the same assay or with the same number of atoms can been treated as being from the same environments, i.e., the same distribution (see Sec. 3.4.1 of DrugOOD paper). For the other six datasets the authors used from DrugOOD , the authors also adopt the official default data splits for all. \n\nA: The setting and used datasets (especially the four datasets from OGB) of the proposed work just follow the above works, and thus, to save space, the authors omitted some detailed descriptions for used datasets and the background information for the distribution/environment in the proposed original version. Now the authors provide detailed information below and supplement them in Appendix E in the uploaded revision. \n - **BBBP** is a dataset of Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration. Each molecule has a label indicating whether it can penetrate through brain cell membrane to enter central nervous system.\n - **BACE** is a dataset of binding affinity against human beta-secretas 1. Each molecule has a label indicating whether it binds to human beta-secretase 1.\n - **SIDER** is a dataset of marked drugs and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Molecules are grouped into 27 system organ classes.\n - **HIV** is a dataset of HIV antiviral activity. Each molecule has an active or inactive label.\n - **IC50/EC50-scaffold/assay/size** are datasets generated by the automated dataset curator provided by DrugOOD from the large-scale bioassay deposition website ChEMBL [4]. The suffix specifies the splitting scheme. These six datasets target on ligand-based affinity prediction (LBAP).

Hence, the nature of GenTD is very different from GTD. To elaborate further, GTD adopts an objective function that takes the average over the behavior sampling distribution. As a result, GTD could suffer from large bias error even when the expressive power of the approximation function class is very large or complete (as the authors demonstrate in the proposed counter-example). In contrast, the proposed GenTD corrects the behavior sampling distribution to the target stationary distribution via learning the density ratio, and is thus guaranteed to converge to the ground truth value functions as long as the expressive power of the approximation function class is sufficiently large. Note that such an advantage of GenTD over GTD is demonstrated by the proposed counterexample. In fact, the main contribution of the paper is to study the general value function (GVF) evaluation problem, i.e., evaluating multi-dimensional value functions with correlations, not the scalar value function evaluation problem for which TD/GTD was typically studied in the literature. It is a not trivial fact whether applying GenTD to such a much more challenging GVF problem can have good performance or guaranteed convergence. In fact, it can diverge for arbitrary GVF problems. The contribution of this paper is to show that many GVF problems encountered in RL practice do satisfy a causal filtering structure, which guarantees that GenTD can be applied with provable convergence."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

This is, in fact, an understatement: The proof of Proposition 2 allows a broader class of couplings that achieve exactly the covariance given in Eq. (10), but also decrease G. In other words: *While the proposed theory only shows how S can be brought to zero, it leaves room for the involved coupling layers to reduce G*. The authors give the details for this more general result in the updated text surrounding Proposition 2.\nShowing a convergence rate for G is beyond the scope of this work, however.\n\nThis also brings to light that the proposed theory does not only hold for affine coupling blocks (i.e. Glow/RealNVP). Indeed, the proposed results also apply to all other coupling architectures that can represent linear functions. This is the case for all coupling architectures aware to us, i.e. NICE (Dinh et al. 2014), RealNVP (Dinh et al. 2016), and GLOW (Kingma & Dhariwal, 2018); Flow++ (Ho et al. 2019); nonlinear-squared flow (Ziegler & Rush 2019); linear, quadratic (Müller et al. 2019), cubic (Durkan et al. 2019a), and rational quadratic splines (Durkan et al. 2019b); neural autoregressive flows (Huang et al. 2020), and unconstrained monotonic neural networks (Wehenkel & Louppe, 2019). *For all these architectures, the proposed theory guarantees the demonstrated convergence of the non-Standardness*.

Existing methods are easy to overfit and usually attain unsatisfactory performance as the learned rank concepts are mainly derived from the vision training set. Since learning the rank concept from the image domain alone is prone to overfitting, the authors can leverage multimodal information to alleviate this issue. The human language contains rich semantic information and prior knowledge. The authors consider simultaneously borrowing the rank concept from the language domain. Specifically, each rank label is not only regarded as a class category but also linked to a sentence describing the corresponding rank, such as \"this person is 23 years old\". In this way, the proposed model not only learns the concept of ranks defined on the vision dataset but also exploits the common knowledge of rank in the language domain.\n\nHow does language information help with this task? In practice, the authors employ the pre-trained giant text encoder in CLIP to extract language prototypes for all ranks. Since the prototypes are obtained from a fixed language model, the authors are somehow distilling the language knowledge from the CLIP model. Moreover, the prototypes are constrained in the well-learned language latent space, which is also a kind of regularization leading to stronger generalization.\n\nAny experiments? To see the benefits of language priors, the authors first consider the zero-shot setting. The authors conducted two experiments: 1) without Language Priors (w/o LP), the classifier is a random initialized FC layer, 2) with Language Priors (w/ LP), the classifier is language initialized prototypes with the CLIP text encoder. Neither experiment involves model training. The results in Table R1-6 show that the w/ LP solution significantly outperforms the w/o LP across four datasets, which indicates that the CLIP model does contain a meaningful representation of rank numbers to some extent, and language information can help with this task. \n\nThe authors agree that CLIP may not be able to give a perfect representation of some arbitrary number simply using raw text input. Therefore the authors propose to learn rank prompts. Here the authors consider the full-training setting, where the full model is trained. w/ P refers to the proposed OrdinalCLIP and w/o LP means that the language prototypes are replaced with an FC layer. The results show the effectiveness of language priors again."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The authors use a bi-directional GRU to encode the input sequence and get the final state of the path. After that, the authors integrate this sequential information into Transformer as an inductive bias. \nUnlike the proposed model, the Great biases the attention vias manually designed structural edges and Code Transformer counts multiple distances to leverage code structure. The baselines convert one edge or distance into a embedding vector as a bias for the attention module.

From Tab. #3, the authors can see that, when removing language from the tracking inference, the performance of VLT_SCAR heavily drops from 65.2%/48.3% to 50.8%/39.5% in SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K under 0-tensor setting, and 63.9%/49.8% to 53.4%/41.1 under template (i.e., visual pooling feature) setting.

Structure of the error model: Note that what the authors propose is a structural error model that allows for interpretation and critical assessment of model misspecification. Approaches using nuisance parameters commonly use a simpler error model, e.g. additive noise to extend the range of possible values.\n2. Decoupling the simulator and the error model provides additional insight: By analysing differences between observed data $y$ and simulated data $x$ the modeller can be aided in improving the simulation model. Knowing which summary statistics are misspecified and observing the effect on the distribution can be crucial for model development. \n3. Including what is known to improve computational efficiency: Since the authors do have a distributional model for the error the authors can include this information in the inference procedure. The alternative would be to rely on NPE to learn the dependence on a potentially difficult heavy tailed distribution (such as a Cauchy distribution), i.e. to recover an element of the simulator that is already known. \n4. Black-box applicability: The error model can be integrated into existing black-box inference packages, such as SBI, and augment NPE. This allows practitioners access to interpretable insights into model misspecification without having to manipulate their code or alternatively to check a simulation model that is otherwise only available as black-box itself."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In practice, their experiments suggest (as is often the case for factorized approaches) that only global minima (or at least local minima with a transportation cost very close to the optimal one) are attractive and therefore the non-convexity of the objective does not seem to be an obstacle here. Indeed, in Fig. 4, the authors show that whatever the initialization considered, the algorithm converges toward the same value. Therefore if the authors were able to initialize the algorithm close to the global minima the authors would also converge towards this value, meaning that the value obtained is at least very close to the optimal one. Moreover, experiments in Fig. 1~3 illustrate the above statement as well. In Fig. 1, the authors observe that the proposed statistic (computed using the algorithm proposed in Scetbon et al. [2021]) converges towards 0 according to the theoretical rates obtained. In Fig. 2, the authors recover the target distribution meaning that the authors correctly minimize DLOT (which requires having access to a meaningful gradient of DLOT computed by solving the LOT problems involved in DLOT).

However, the pointwise formulation is in fact **more desirable and more powerful**. \nFirstly, a pointwise argument can be easily converted into a distributional one, but the reverse is difficult. Given a distribution of $x_0$ and the (pointwise) ‘lethal dose’ for each $x_0$, one can define the distribution of the ‘lethal dose’ and its statistics as the distributional ‘lethal dose’. However, it is hard to uncover the ‘lethal dose’ for each $x_0$ from distributional arguments. Secondly, samples are not equally difficult in most if not all applications of machine learning: To achieve the same level of accuracy on different test samples, the number of training samples required can also be very different.\nFor example, on MNIST, which is a task to recognize handwritten digits, samples of digits ‘1’ are usually easier for models to learn and predict accurately, while those of digits ‘6’, ‘8’ and ‘9 are harder as they can look more alike. In consequence, the authors do not expect them to be equally vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Compared to a distributional one, the pointwise argument better incorporates such observations.\n"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

[2021a] do not suffer the $\\log T$ factor is because they only consider the whole interval $[1,T]$. In contrast, the proposed dynamic regret bound holds for *any* possible interval, and the $\\log T$ factor is the price paid for adaptivity. The combiner in Zhang et al. [2021a] is the standard Hedge algorithm, which is applied to the linearized loss with switching cost. It attains an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ bound of regret over the interval $[1,T]$, but ignores all the other intervals (cf. Lemma 1 in their paper). On the other hand, the combiner in this paper is able to minimize the regret with switching cost in *every* interval (i.e., Corollary 2). If the authors only care about the single interval $[1,T]$, the authors can also get rid of the $\\log T$ factor based on Lemma 15 of Kapralov and Panigrahy [2010].\n[R1] L. Zhang, W. Jiang, S.

AIR, as a factor-based model, can obtain a better segmentation performance when the inter-object shape variation is ablated from real-world datasets. The result of other three layer-based models, however, are less relevant to the scene-level shape factor. The authors believe it is because objects are  represented by explicit factors (such as scale, position, appearance) in a factor-based model, and the scene is then modelled as a spatial combination of objects. Such design forces objects to be bounded within a region. In contrast, in layer-based models where objects are modeled by masks, there are less spatial-locality constraints.\n- Layer-based models are more more sensitive to object color gradient and inter-object color similarity. As discussed above, layer-based models have a less constraint on spatial-locality of objects, which allows more flexible pixel clustering. Thus, the segmentation decision has a higher dependency on color information. If an object is too colorful, it is likely to be segmented into multiple components. If objects in a scene are too similar in terms of color, they can be hard to be segmented apart. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, SNN has its own distinctive properties, which have increasingly aroused researchers’ great interest in recent years.The authors think SNNs have three main advantages:\n\n1) SNNs use binary activations, which are more efficient than 8-bit ones, because the authors do not need to do multiplications. Instead, the authors just add the synaptic weight to the potential when there is an input spike (Accumulate operation vs. Multiply-Accumulate operation). \n\n2) Due to the event-driven calculation, sparse activation, and multiplication-free characteristics, the existing neuromorphic chips have shown that SNNs have greater energy efficiency than ANN. \n\n3) SNNs have inherent adversarial robustness.

However, for GDA, it requires bounded gradient assumption on $y$ to show the convergence of this term, and without such assumption, the authors can only show the convergence of $f(x_t,y^*(x_{s})) - f(x_{t },y_{t+1})$, so Lin et al split the  $\\Phi(x_{t }) - f(x_{t },y_{t})$ as follow:\n$\\Phi( x_t) - f( x_{t }, y_{t }) \\leq f(x_{t }, y^*( x_{t }))-f( x_{t}, y^*( x_{s}))+f(x_{t+1}, y_{t+1}) - f( x_{t }, y_t)  + f( x_{t }, y_{t+1}) - f( x_{t+1}, y_{t+1})+ f( x_t, y^*(x_s)) - f(x_t, y_{t+1}) $.\nHence they reduce the problem to bounding $f(x_{t },y^*(x_{s})) - f(x_{t },y_{t+1})$.

There are two typical solutions: 1) do the teacher forcing with respect to all possible ground truths - this is the $O(N^2)$ problem, or 2) design a surrogate distance metric that does not require generation so that the assignment can be performed regardless of the teacher forcing. The former approach is impractical due to heavy resource requirements while the latter approach is far from trivial, especially in the general domain.

But both $\\mu$ and and $\\Sigma$ are parameterized using an image-to-image DNN which connects each input to each output pixel.

How to include it into GStarX?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors totally agree with the reviewer that different features can have different importance for GNN predictions. Feature importance explanation is thus a meaningful and critical part of practical GNN explanation. This point has been studied together with node importance in the earlier GNN explanation works like GNNExplainer, as well as some recent milestone works like ZORRO [1] suggested by the reviewer. The authors choose to exclude the feature importance explanation for two reasons.\n\n* Feature dimensions of many graph datasets are not interpretable. Like the text graph dataset GraphSST2 used in SubgraphX and the proposed work, the node features are 768-dimensional word vectors. Identifying the importance of each dimension for these node features can thus be less meaningful. On the other hand, the text graphs are probably the best type of graphs for qualitative evaluation of explainers, given the lack of ground truth for explaining general graphs. The importance of keywords (nodes) to sentence sentiment prediction (graph label prediction) can be easily understood when visualized. \n\n* For many of the recent works like PGExplainer, SubgraphX, OrphicX, etc, the explanation was only performed at the node/edge level. Their argument is that feature importance is not unique to graphs and has been extensively studied in general model explanability literature. As a work focusing on GNN explanation, feature importance is good to have but may not be a core contribution. Given these methods are important baselines for the proposed method, the authors choose not to include node feature importance at this time for a fair comparison to these methods.\nNevertheless, feature importance explanation is indeed important and can be incorporated into the proposed method as well. One idea is to perturb the graph nodes and node features together as in the GraphSVX paper. Specifically, when explaining a graph with N nodes and feature dimension D, instead of scoring induced subgraphs by picking nodes from the size-N set, the authors can extend the scoring function to take in an induced subgraph with a subset of features, i.e., picking from the size-(N+D) set. The unpicked features can be set as zero. In this way, the feature importance can be included to make the final explanation more complete. Given the limited time of the rebuttal period, the authors leave the implementation of this idea and the exploration of smarter ways for including feature importance as future work. The authors have revised the PDF to clearly stated the proposed limitation of feature importance explanation in Section 4.3 (lines 194 - 197) and state this future direction in Section 7 (line 337 - 339)."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Compared to the two-step optimization method that first fitting the output of noise module to $r(t)$, and then use the output to optimize the final loss function, the one-step optimization method is always shown to be better since the two-step method is a kind of greedy method that the local optimum in each step may not converge to the global optimum for the final goal."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Additionally, why is the proposed method better than myopic methods?", "reference_answer": "A: In this work, the authors consider online model-poisoning attacks against federated learning, which is a sequential decision making problem under uncertainty (from the attacker’s perspective) and RL is a natural framework for it. Compared with previous one-shot methods (e.g., LMP, IPM, and EB), the goal of an RL attack is non-myopic, that is, maximizing the attackers’ long-term expected rewards. A one-step optimizing goal is usually sub-optimal, especially when a robust aggregation rule is adopted.  It is observed in the experiments that the FL system can often recover quickly from a bad model under myopic attacks while RL can slow down the process (see Figures 3(c) and 3(d) in the paper). With potential strong defenses, it is crucial to attack in a “low-and-slow” way so that the attack effects will accumulate even if the one step attack ability is limited by the defense. In an FL system, since the next global model depends on the current one and the clients’ actions, it is natural to model it as a Markov decision process, which captures the evolution of the global model during FL training. \nThe authors choose deep-RL with dimension reduction (see Section 3.3 and Appendix D.1) to solve the attacker’s MDP, since it is typically more efficient than traditional dynamic programming and linear programming based methods, at the cost of being sample-inefficient and unstable as the reviewer points out. To solve the first problem, they have considered a model-based approach by building a simulator using the learned data distribution. To solve the second problem, they can set up a separate testing environment to identify the best trained policies as the authors briefly mentioned in the experiment section. On the other hand, they observed in the experiments that a sufficiently trained RL policy can typically obtain strong attack performance despite the instability.

Where is the origin? How is the transformation done?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors have added them to Appendix section 1.2. For rotation, the total number of bins is 8,712. To be precise, the authors enumerate 363 rotation axes in 3D space. For each axis, the authors enumerate 24 rotation angles. For the translation, the total number of bins is 21,952. In Appendix section 2.2, the authors have conducted several analytical experiments to study the discretization of these two operations. The results show that a) without discretization, the model can not generate molecules that fit the input shape, because of the non-linear relationship between quaternions and rotation angles b) with discretization, different bin sizes (7.5/15/30) do not have a significant difference. While due to the trade-off between the granularity of the bin and the accuracy of the model, the number of the bin does not significantly affect the results. For a fragment, the authors set its centroid as the origin. Because when handling a fragment, in order to align the same fragment in different 3D poses, the authors need to build up an internal coordinate that is not influenced by the external transformation. As the authors can determine the centroid of a fragment no matter what 3D pose it is, the authors treat it as the origin of the internal coordinate. For rotation operation and translation operation, the transformation is done as follows:\n  - the authors represent the $i$-th rotation bin as a quaternion $q^{\\mathrm{bin}}_i\\in\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The discreterization of any continuous rotation operator $q \\in\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ can be computed by $\\underset{i}{\\arg \\min}\\|q^{\\mathrm{bin}}_i, q\\|_2$.\n  - the authors represent the $i$-th translation bin as the coordinate of its centre $t^{\\mathrm{bin}}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

However, the authors found that it is impossible in real-world high-dimensional data. To see this, the authors conduct an additional experiment. The authors randomly sample 5 classes in the test-time dataset (i.e., 5-way task). Then the authors calculate the cosine similarity between the task centroid and those lines connecting all possible pairs of classes. Thus for such a task the authors calculate 10 similarities (i.e., 10 possible combinations of classes). For each test-time dataset, the authors sample 2000 such 5-way tasks and report the average similarity as well as the maximum similarity among all $20000$ (i.e. $2000\n\\times10$ calculated similarities.

Therefore, the above hard packing constraints can be translated into a set of linear equality constraints $\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)=0$ such that the violation  $r_{j,h}^{(m)}(s_h,a_h)<c_j^{(m)}$ occurs for at least one $j$. Note that the original covering constraints $V_{j}^{(m)}(\\pi) \\ge c_j^{(m)}$ are also imposed on policy $\\pi$. Therefore, the authors just need to adjust the proposed primal-dual algorithm to handle both the inequality and equality constraints on policy $\\pi$. The authors elaborate it in the following aspects: \n\n(1) The Slater's condition becomes more stringent, i.e., the stochastic modification $\\phi^{(m)}$ should satisfy not only the inequality $V^{(m)}(\\phi^{(m)}\\circ\\pi)-c^{(m)}\\ge \\xi^{(m)}$ but also the above equality constraints; \n\n(2) Strong duality still holds. In the new Lagrange function, the authors add terms like $+\\mu\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)$ where $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the above equality constraint. Note that the equality constraint $\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)=0$ is equivalent to the linear constraint on policy-induced joint measure $p_{\\pi}(s_{1:h},a_{1:h})=0$, where the trajectory $\\{s_{1:h},a_{1:h}\\}$ contains at least one infeasible state-action pair $s_h,a_h$ (i.e., $r_{j,h}^{(m)}(s_h,a_h)<c_j^{(m)}$). Hence, the Lagrange function is still linear w.r.t. $p_{\\pi}$, which a key property required for proving strong duality;\n\n(3) The algorithm is similar to the current version. For the primal update in eq. (11), note that the constraint $\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)=0$ can be equivalently written as a covering constraint $\\mathbb{E} _ {\\pi} \\big[\\sum _ {h=1} ^ {H}r _ {eq,h} ^ {(m)}$ $(\\widetilde{s} _ {h},\\widetilde{a} _ {h})\\big]=0$ where the equality-related reward $r _ {eq,h} ^ {(m)}(\\widetilde{s} _ {h},\\widetilde{a} _ {h})$ is defined as follows: $r _ {eq,h'} ^ {(m)} (\\widetilde{s} _ {h'},\\widetilde{a} _ {h'})=1$ if $h'=h$ and $(\\widetilde{s} _ {h'},\\widetilde{a} _ {h'})=(s_h,a_h)$; Otherwise, $r _ {eq,h'} ^ {(m)} (\\widetilde{s} _ {h'},\\widetilde{a} _ {h'})=0$.\nTherefore, the authors just need to add $\\mu r _ {eq,h} ^ {(m)}(s_{h},a_{h})$ to the surrogate reward. For the projected dual descent step in eq. (12), the update for $\\lambda_t^{(m)}$ remains the same whereas the update for $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ uses gradient descent $\\mu\\leftarrow\\mu-\\eta\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)$ without projection; \n\n(4) The remaining convergence proof follows the same logic as the current proof.

For real datasets without the ground truth, fidelity and inverse fidelity provide meaningful evaluation. However, the difficulty is that the fidelity of explanation with different sparsity is not directly comparable. For example, using the whole graph as an explanation will most likely result in much higher fidelity than using any single node in a graph. However, the whole-graph explanation is not sparse at all, and directly comparing these two fidelities is not fair. SubgraphX chooses to compare methods using fidelity vs. sparsity plots for a range of sparsity. The authors have both the fidelity vs. sparsity plot and the inverse fidelity vs. sparsity plot for each dataset in Figure 4 in Appendix A.4. These plots show that the proposed method outperforms baselines in most cases. The numbers in Table 1 are a normalized summary of the curves shown in Figure 4, it summarizes the fidelity and inverse fidelity analogously to the F1-score summarizes precision and recall, so the authors can quickly compare methods using a single number, which saves space for showing all the plots and save time for interpreting all the curves in the plots. Nevertheless, the plots are shown in Figure 4 in Appendix A.4 for a closer comparison.\n[1] Pope, P. E., Kolouri, S., Rostami, M., Martin, C. E., and Hoffmann, H.

The key difference between the proposed method and pre/in-processing approaches lies in that the proposed approach does not change the training data or interfere with the model training process.

The proposed method focuses on the case, where the authors have no access to the training process at all but only the model.  The proposed method is also applicable to black-box settings (empirical results are shown in Appendix B), where the authors could correct a biased model without accessing the model parameters/gradients, which provides us a significant advantage over other in-processing approaches.

However, neural network optimization (the inner-level problem in the proposed work) is typically far from convergence. \n2) The meta-gradient computed by implicit differentiation also assumes the uniqueness of the inner solution and certain regularity conditions. \n3) In implicit differentiation, the authors need to compute the inverse Hessian, which is typically approximated by an iterative linear solver, such as truncated gradient or Neumann series. \n4) Implicit differentiation is computed at some approximated solution and does not care about how the authors arrive at this point. \n\nCompared to implicit differentiation proposed by Lorraine et al. 2020, the proposed methods have the following advantages: \n1) The proposed method is based on unrolled optimization, and the authors do not make any assumptions as in the implicit function theorem. \n2) It considers the training dynamics of neural networks by model online update.

Generic proof techniques in the deterministic case are not directly applicable. 2- One possible approach to achieve $\\epsilon$-global stationary point, is to use fixed batch-sizes in all the iterations such that the error terms are bounded in the order of $\\epsilon$. Instead, the authors showed that it suffices to make sure that the error terms are decaying at the same rate as the function values (Lemma 10 in Appendix A.3). Combining this idea with a variance-reduction technique yields a novel method which reduces the sample complexity to $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ for $\\alpha=1$. 3- The authors proposed an expectation analysis for SCRN under gradient dominance property with $1\\leq \\alpha\\leq 3/2$ which requires weaker assumptions than the bounded centered gradient and Hessian estimators which are commonly assumed for analyzing SCRN in general non-convex setting in the literature. Under gradient dominance condition with $1\\leq \\alpha\\leq 3/2$, dependency of Hessian sample complexity on dimension is reduced from $poly(d)$ to $\\log d$ ($d$ is the dimension of the ambient space) by using a version of matrix moment inequality (See Lemma 3 in Appendix)."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, the proposed key technology is **significantly different** from theirs:\n- First, they use curriculum learning for **unlabeled data selection**, i.e., use the model trained on the labeled dataset to manually label unlabeled data, and then *add the pseudo-labeled data to enlarge the labeled dataset*. In contrast, the authors use curriculum learning to render the pseudo labels *to different classes* and *at different time steps*, which is determined by dynamic thresholds.\n- Second, the ways of using curriculum learning are also different. They **manually** pre-define the curriculum pace by using the percentile increasing from 0% to 100% with 20% increments each time. In contrast, the authors **automate** the thresholds in each iteration and for each class according to the model’s learning status, which means the thresholds can *increase, decrease or stay unchanged*. Therefore, the proposed CPL is more flexible and does not involve man-made predefinitions (i.e. 20% increments). \n- Third, the authors do **not** do select-add-and-train like they did since it would introduce extra computations (e.g. extra forward propagations when using the trained model to select), the proposed CPL is cost-free but effective. \n- Finally, the proposed method has much **stronger** results compared to theirs and can be easily adapted to existing SSL algorithms. Specifically, their proposed methods have **worse** results than FixMatch using the same model settings (i.e. WRN-28, ResNet50), whereas ours can **substantially outperform** the current SOTA algorithm: FixMatch. For instance, on CIFAR10-4000-label split, their error rate is **5.27** while ours is **3.95**; with **500 labels**, their error rate deteriorates to about **10.50** whereas ours with **250 labels** is **4.80** and with **only 40 labels** is **4.99**."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

In this experiment, the authors compared the accuracy of the estimated regional importance obtained by the following three different estimation methods.\n(1) The first method is to estimate the regional importance based on the raw features $f$, i.e. The authors directly use the method in Line 210-217 to estimate $w^{(r)}$ as the regional importance.\n(2) The second method is to estimate the regional importance based on the projected features $h$. This estimation is the similar as the above estimation of $w^{(r)}$. The only exception is that the authors replace the sample-wise similarity $Q_w(x_2|x_1)\\propto{\\prod}_r Q_w (f_2^{(r)}|f_1)^{w_2^{(r)}}$ in Line 216 with $Q_w (x_2|x_1)\\propto{\\prod}_r Q_w (h_2^{(r)}|h_1)^{w_2^{(r)}}$. The authors use $\\hat{w}^{(r)}$ to denote the regional importance estimated using this method.\n(3) The third method is to directly use the classification confidence of a projected regional feature $h^{(r)}$ to its ground-truth category as its regional importance, i.e. $\\tilde{w}^{(r)}=\\log\\frac{p(y\\ =\\ c^{\\text{t r u t h}}\\ |\\ h^{(r)})}{1\\ -\\ p(y\\ =\\ c^{\\text{t r u t h}}\\ |\\ h^{(r)})}$.\nIn this way, to verify the claim, the authors aim to prove that the regional importance estimated by the first method is more accurate than the regional importance estimated by the second or the third method. To this end, the accuracy of each regional importance is measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient between the estimated regional importance and Shapley values $\\phi^{(r)}$. A higher value of the correlation indicates higher accuracy of the estimated region importance. Given a certain input image, the authors measured the Pearson correlation coefficient between $w^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$, the Pearson correlation coefficient between $\\hat{w}^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between $\\tilde{w}^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$, over different regional features. For each estimation method, the authors averaged the correlation through all input images. The table below shows that the correlation between $w^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$ was higher than the correlation between $\\hat{w}^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$, and the correlation between  $\\tilde{w}^{(r)}$ and $\\phi^{(r)}$. This showed the high accuracy of estimating regional importance based on raw features $f$.

While these existing distillation strategies have shown remarkable success in distillation tasks such as model compression, they rarely (carefully) study the role of graph geometry in GNN iterations. For geometric knowledge transfer task, it is crucial to find a fundamental and principled way to track how graph topology affects the behavior of a specific GNN.

Structured denoising diffusion models in discrete state-spaces. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, pp.17981-17993.", "reference_answer": "A: To construct the proposed framework for classification, the authors assume the class labels in terms of one-hot vectors are from real continuous spaces instead of discrete ones. This assumption enables us to model the forward diffusion process and prior distribution at timestep T with Gaussian distributions, thus all derivations with analytical computation of KL terms, as well as corresponding algorithms, generalize naturally into the classification settings. The code for training and inference are exactly the same (in file diffusion_utils.py). Discrete diffusion models D3PMs fit conventional perception in classification tasks naturally by keeping the assumption of a categorical distribution. Therefore, the corresponding evaluation metrics like NLL can directly translate into such framework – the authors believe that by adopting the discrete space assumption, a better NLL metric can be achieved. Meanwhile, it would require a lot more changes to be made from the proposed framework for regression tasks, including the choice of transition matrix, the incorporation of $x$ into the diffusion processes, as well as the addition of the auxiliary loss into the objective function – all of the above are classification-task-specific settings, and cannot be adopted with the existing framework for regression tasks.\nBesides the intention for consistency and generalizability across the two types of supervised learning tasks, the authors found that such construction gives reasonable results to access model prediction confidence at instance level – by directly use the prediction intervals obtained in the raw continuous space, i.e., before adopting the softmax function for conversion to probability space, the authors obtain the sharp contrast in PIW between correct and incorrect predictions, and can already achieve high accuracy by merely predicting the label with the narrowest PIW for each instance. After such conversion, the PIW contrast is reduced drastically, and the prediction accuracy by narrowest PIW is similar to a random guess.\n\nTo recap, if achieving the best NLL and ECE for classification is the goal, then the authors think discrete diffusion models like Austin et al. (2021) could be excellent choices due to their use of the cross-entropy loss that is directed related to NLL and ECE; however, if the main goal is on modeling the confidence on predicted label probabilities, the proposed CARD works well, and it would be interesting to make a head-to-head comparison with discrete diffusion-based classification models that yet need to be developed.

The first challenge is how to reasonably define orthogonal propagation. Orthogonality is a concept of linear algebra, and orthogonal matrix is a matrix $X$, which follows $X^TX = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Thus, it is direct to employ this definition to the feature transformation matrix $X$ in Ortho-GConv. However, it is not trivial to define orthogonal propagation. Since the propagation matrix $A$ is a given adjacency matrix, making it follow the definition of the orthogonal matrix is unconscionable. To overcome this difficulty, OPEN assigns the orthogonality constrains to the propagation weights of one node in two channels. The second challenge is how to elegantly obtain orthogonal propagation weights for each node. To this end, OPEN proposes to perform PCA on each ego-network, since the mapping directions in PCA are from EVD, where the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

In particular, their SOX algorithm views their moving average update, i.e., \n$$\n\\mathbf u_t^i=(1-\\beta) \\mathbf u_{t-1}^i + \\beta g_i(\\mathbf w_t; \\xi^i_t), i\\in\\mathcal B_1^t\n$$\n\nas stochastic block coordinate update for the (dynamic) objective $ g_t(\\mathbf u)=\\sum_{i=1}^m\\\\|\\mathbf{u}^i - g_i(\\mathbf w_t)\\\\|^2/2$. From this perspective, the proposed estimator MSVR can be viewed as applying a momentum-based stochastic block coordinate update for the same objective, with the update \n\n$$\n    q^i_t = \\nabla_i g_t(\\mathbf u_{t-1};\\xi^i_t) + \\theta_t (\\nabla_i g_t(\\mathbf u_{t-1};\\xi^i_t) - \\nabla_i g_{t-1}(\\mathbf u_{t-1};\\xi^i_{t})), \\quad \\mathbf u^i_t = \\mathbf u^i_{t-1} - \\beta_t q^i_t\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nabla_i g_t(\\mathbf u_{t-1};\\xi^i_t)=\\mathbf u^i_{t-1} - g_i(\\mathbf w_t; \\xi_t^i)$ and $\\theta_t = \\gamma_t/\\beta_t$. The second term in $q^i_t$ is a momentum term, which is an additional term compared with that of SOX update for $\\mathbf u^i_t$. \n\nHowever,  to the best of the proposed knowledge, there is no prior work analyzing the above momentum-based stochastic block coordinate update. Indeed, the proposed goal is not to optimize $ g_t(\\mathbf u)$. Instead the authors aim to bound $\\sum_{t=1}^T\\\\|\\mathbf u_t^i  - g_i(\\mathbf w_t)\\\\|^2$ for a sequence of $\\mathbf w_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf w_T$.  Hence, existing methods and analysis on variance reduction and block coordinate updates that focus on optimizing a given fixed objective cannot be applied here.   In another word,  the proposed analysis and its synthesis with the update for FCCO is novel.\n\n---"}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Blue noise is essential for generating high-quality halftones, which avoids noticeable low frequency visual artifacts in the generated halftones by forcing random pixel dithering. To achieve this goal, the meta-halftone guided network constructs a meta-halftone set with the help of the diffusion state vectors of $k$ constant grayscale images, and guides the generation of new halftone dithering patterns through these meta-halftone vectors. \n\nTo verify the effectiveness of the proposed meta-halftone guided network, the authors conduct ablation experiments to evaluate the quality of generated halftones. Specifically, the authors evaluate the generated halftones in terms of tone consistency and structure consistency (Pang et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2021). Tone consistency is calculated by the peak signal-to-noise ratio between the generated halftones and the input continuous-tone images, where the halftones are smoothed by a Gaussian filter kernel. Structure consistency is computed by SSIM metric between the generated halftones and the input continuous-tone images. The authors compare the halftone quality with and without meta-halftone guided networks in quantitative experiments, and the experimental results are shown below.\n\nMethod | Structure Consistency | Tone Consistency\n- | - | -\nMeta-halftone Guided Network | 0.1283 | 24.51\nMeta-halftone Guided Network | 0.1550 | 26.56\n\nIt can be observed that when using the meta-halftone guided network, the generated halftones have higher tone consistency and structure consistency with original continuous-tone images, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed meta-halftone guided network.\n\nThe pretrained VGG network is used for feature extraction of constant grayscale images, and the authors also perform feature mapping (Eq. 15) on the VGG features to learn task-related feature representations. The reason for using pre-training is to save the consumption of computing resources and training time, making the meta-halftone guided network more lightweight (only contains 81K training parameters).

In particular,\n- **AIR**:  As a factor based model, AIR has a strong spatial-locality bias. Despite its poor segmentation performance across all datasets, there is a notable improvement when inter-object shape variation is ablated from real-world datasets (U / T+U / S+C+U / S+C+T+U). More convincingly, even when all other three factors are ablated (S+C+T), it can be hardly improved. These observations show that object shape variation is a significant factor for AIR.\n- **MONet**:  MONet is more sensitive to color-related factors than shape-related factors. The ablations of object color gradient and inter-object color similarity significantly improve its performance, while ablations of object shape concavity and inter-object shape variation make little differences. For the two color-related factors, the scene-level one is more important than the object-level factor. From this, the authors can see that MONet has a strong dependency on color. Similar colors tend to be grouped together while different colors are separated apart. Furthermore, the ablation on object color gradient alleviates over-segmentation whereas the ablation on inter-object color similarity alleviates under-segmentation. The authors conjecture that under-segmentation can be a more severe issue for MONet on real-world datasets, leading to a larger sensitivity on the scene-level color factor.\n- **IODINE**: IODINE also has a heavy dependency on both object- and scene-level color-related factors. However, different from MONet, the ablation on object color gradient brings better performance than inter-object color similarity. The authors speculate it is because the regularization on shape latent alleviates under-segmentation by bias towards more regular shapes. In this way, over-segmentation is the key issue, making the inter-object color similarity a dominant factor.\n- **SlotAtt**: The ablations on all four factors increase the performance of SlotAtt at different levels, among which object- and scene-level color-related factors are more significant. The authors conjecture that it is because the feature embeddings used by Slot Attention module are learnt from both pixel colors and coordinates, which contributes to its sensitivity to both shape and color factors.\n\nSince existing models usually consist of multiple network components, to fully investigate the effectiveness of each individual building block involves comprehensive ablations on network components. This is left for the future work, and the proposed work focuses on extensive ablations and analysis from the perspective of dataset factors.

The change in the number of \"soft constraints\" is $nd$ minus the number of BCs.

The authors speculate that it may be due to the fact that competition between PDEs and BCs is greater than that between PDEs.

In general, the authors partition the whole Transformer search space into $K=3$ sub-spaces such that each sub-space covers different sizes of student models (by number of parameters) depicting Tiny, Small and Base model sizes. Given a BERT-sized teacher model (109$M$ params), the authors roughly set the partition thresholds for Tiny, Small and Base sizes at 10$M$, 40$M$ and 80$M$ params. From Table 2 (\\#Para column), the authors observe that each partition contains compressed models from prior work -- allowing us to fairly compare the models in each partition on accuracy vs. params/FLOPs. \nFor the proposed search space, each partition still contains thousands of candidate subnetworks not all of which are useful. Now, the authors leverage two primary heuristics (lines 129-136): (i) the authors constrain all layers in a sampled student subnetwork to be homogeneous i.e., the same number of attention heads, hidden dimension, etc. This not only reduces the search space, it is also more friendly to hardware and software frameworks. (ii) Motivated by previous work [1-2] showing that thinner and deeper neural networks have better representation capabilities and perform better than wider and shallower neural networks, the authors designed sub-spaces with deeper layers (e.g., $4-7$ for Tiny, $9-12$ for Small and Base) and compute the range of hidden dimensions to meet the overall model parameter budget in each partition. Additional constraints arise from Transformer design principles, for instance, hidden size is always a multiple of the number of attention heads. While the above steps require enumeration of different subnetwork architectures, this is typically fast given an algebraic expression to compute model parameters as a function of layers, heads, hidden size, etc. (included in submitted source code), does not require any training, and a one-time process depending only on the teacher model architecture.

PMLR, 2021.", "reference_answer": "A: The main differences as also highlighted under **novelty** consist of the following:\n\n- **Fully task-agnostic SuperNet training**. {AutoDistil} training is fully task-agnostic in contrast to Zhao et al. [r1] that uses task-specific NAS. Task-agnostic NAS is challenging since the authors do not have access to task labels during training and the authors want to show generalization on evaluating diverse downstream NLU tasks in the GLUE benchmark. AutoDistil leverages self-attention distillation that is an unsupervised training objective. Incorporating self-attention loss for training and distillation in NAS is non-trivial as it requires aligning attention states of diverse student subnetworks and the large teacher model. The authors develop an extraction and alignment strategy (Section 3.2) to address this challenge.\n\n- **NLP vs. CV domain**. AutoDistil works on the NLP domain with the Transformer architecture (see Figure 2) under the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, while reference [1] works on the CV domain with a CNN architecture with different design and search spaces. Different from CV domain, NLP tasks have different objectives and evaluation metrics for classification (e.g., MNLI), regression (e.g., STS-B) and correlation (e.g., CoLA). Overall, the search space design (Section 3.1), SuperNet training with distillation and sub-network extraction strategy (Section 3.2) and search strategy (Section 3.3) are all quite different. While the authors briefly discuss these differences (lines 53-70), the authors will add a more elaborate discussion."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

These tasks are low-resource tasks in the GLUE benchmark [1] since they have limited number of training examples (~$3K$ labels for each) for model fine-tuning. This allows us to evaluate the transferability of the compressed models trained on unlabeled general domain corpus (e.g., Wikipedia, BooksCorpus) and fine-tuned on the above downstream tasks with limited labeled data. \n\nThe authors conducted additional experiments on MNLI; where the authors have a large dataset containing $400K$ labeled examples. Prior work [2] has shown MNLI to transfer well to other tasks in the GLUE benchmark. The authors observe the following performance of different task-agnostic training strategies (Table 4) on the MNLI task: 82.2 (MLM), 83.5 (KD_{att}+Cont.), and 83.2 (KD$_{att}$), respectively. As with MRPC and RTE, the authors make similar observations. (i) Self-attention distillation strategy performs better than MLM for SuperLM training. (ii) There is limited performance gain with continued training (thereby increased computation cost) as done in existing works that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed single-stage training protocol.

For the learning task, the original problem that the authors are interested in to find a model that can perform well on any possible data set, i.e., the ideal target is to find the optimal solution to (5). However, due to the unknown distribution of the data, the best the authors can do is to collect data samples and thus form the empirical minimax risk (1) that is solvable. Results in Section 3 indicates how well the model learnt from training set (i.e., the solution to (1)), is compared to the true model, that is, the solution to (5). In particular, Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 provide the sample complexity for learning a model empirically that is arbitrarily close to the true one. Based on these results, the authors could reasonably expect that problem (1) the authors solve (which is also the only thing solvable in practice) is a good enough approximation to the original problem (5) that the authors are interested in. After figuring the proposed this problem, the next step is to design suitable algorithm that can solve (1) accurately and efficiently in a distributed way (and the authors particularly focus on the federated setting in this paper), which is the main topic of Section 4. To sum up, Section 3 first provides a positive answer that the authors can effectively learn a well-performed model by only accessing to data samples. Next, Section 4 gives an efficient algorithm to solve the problem."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

As the authors can see, layer supervision and stochastic depth can improve both the performance of the main network and the average performance of all subnetworks, stage supervision and self-distillation can only improve the performance of the main network, while the proposed stimulative training can achieve the highest performance of main network and the highest average performance of all subnetworks.

Since these modified reference vectors are meta-trained on base dataset and fixed at test time, there's no guarantee that one of the removed dimensions estimated from support classes aligns with the task centroid. However, if the authors set the reference vector to 0 (although deviating from the original paper that each reference vector represents a class), at this time, the removed dimensions are exactly all directions along classes centroids. Since the task centroid is a linear combination of class centroids, removing these dimensions also removes the dimension along task centroid. This perspective could be very interesting, and the authors will explore more in the near future. Estimating the task centroid by similar base features has some estimation errors, and the details are not mentioned in the paper."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Besides that, QPLEX uses multi-run training, namely, the sampled trajectories are used to conduct the loss minimization for multiple times for each update. However, RMIX has simpler architecture.

The CVaR is a scalar value for policy execution and the risk level predictor only outputs a scalar value for CVaR calculation. The RL framework of RMIX is simpler than that of QPLEX;\n(3) Cautious actions may impede the performance in simpler scenarios.

The authors not only need to consider the data augmentation for two different stages (i.e., meta-gradient computation and online model update), but the authors also need to consider the data augmentation for two different data types (i.e., distilled data and real data). In the proposed experiments, the same kind of data augmentation, cutout (https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552), for example, can improve the performance if applied to the online model update but hurt the performance if it is applied to the meta-gradient computation. Besides, different datasets may require different data augmentations. For example, the authors may want to use image flipping for datasets involving natural images but not for datasets containing digits like MNIST. Moreover, the optimal hyperparameters for different transformations (e.g., color jittering and scaling) are different and need to be tuned separately for each dataset. \n\nIn the proposed experiments, the authors found that applying the correct data augmentation could improve the final test performance by around 1–3%, especially when the authors distilled more data points.

MVSNet tries to find the best matches by computing the variance among different features (some methods compute the correlation instead of the variance). Second, the proposed window-based epipolar inter-attention module aims to improve the feature quality to enhance the feature matching. It is worth noting that the differentiable warping part and the inter-attention module are not in conflict, they work together in the proposed whole pipeline."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Hence, the gradients are highly correlated to the moving direction in the optimization. Eventually, the direction of the gradient can be guaranteed to be broadly correct.

Here are provided some discrepancies between the two methods. The proposed paper method (ESG) is designed manually, and in the experiments, the SNN with ESG is better than the vanilla SNN but will induce no extra computation in the training. While the Dspike[A] is computed by finite difference method, however, evaluating finite difference could be time-consuming, since for each single weight, the model should run two times to evaluate the difference of the loss, and a model can have more than ten million parameters (e.g. 11,200,000 parameters for ResNet18), which greatly slows down the training process. To reduce the computation, the Dspike[A] chooses to only compute the finite difference in the first layer to represent the surrogate gradients of the whole model. However, this is still very time-consuming. Take ResNet20 in Cifar10 for example as introduced in [A], if the authors set batch-size as 128. The computation for the finite difference in the first layer once is equal to ResNet20 inferring about 4.5 epochs on training set. To sum up, the Dspike performs remarkably while is very time-consuming. While ESG method is more efficient with a relatively good performance. Hence, ESG function and Dspike function are both meaningful for SNN field. This is some like that SGD optimizer is designed manually from experience, while Meta-optimizer is learned by learning[B] from optimal scheme.

In contrast, traditional task-agnostic knowledge distillation (KD) methods (e.g., MiniLM) target specific compression rate and needs to be trained repeatedly for different student configurations (corresponding to different resource constraints). Therefore, AutoDistil has a much reduced amortized computation cost even considering traditional KD methods. Further, traditional methods require several trial and errors to come up with a viable candidate architecture given a constraint before running the KD algorithm."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

What happens to values larger than 1? How are even bit depths and associated asymmetries w.r.t. 0 handled?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors agree with the reviewer that it is important to evaluate the potential overhead of bookkeeping. However, the authors should also have in mind that bookkeeping has an intricate relationship with the target hardware, which may lead to radically different results on different hardware platforms (ranging from 0 to ~60%). For example, the proposed experiments show that on specialized hardware, such as the one designed by Albericio et al (2017) for processing variable bit width CNN, the authors can fully offset all bookkeeping overheads of storing quantization depths, while CPU/GPU may require up to 60% additional storage. The authors will study this complex relationship separately, in the proposed future work, and in the context of hardware implementation. In this paper, the authors limit the scope to algorithm analysis, independent of underlying hardware architectures. The authors note that in this analysis, the authors have evaluated the metadata as well as the additional sign bits. The metadata overhead is negligible (about 4 bytes per layer) due to the balanced quantization of algorithm 1 which divides the range [0,1] into equally sized partitions and assigns a single bit to each parameter. As the authors discuss in the answer to the next question, this scheme eliminates the need to convert parameters back to floating-point, and computations can be performed directly on the quantized values. For example, the 5-bit signed value 01011, for example, represents 2^(-1)+2^(-3)+2^(-4)=0.6875 (the initial 0 bit represents a positive value), which can be easily multiplied with other values using fixed-point shifts and additions. If it is necessary to have parameters in a larger range, say [-S, S], a scale value like S (4 bytes of metadata) could be allocated for each layer, that is applied to the output of that layer. The authors have clarified these points in the updated version of the paper, in section 2 and section 3. \n\nAlbericio, Jorge, et al. \"Bit-pragmatic deep neural network computing.\" Proceedings of the 50th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture.

In practice, the authors tend to choose a relatively smaller $Q$ to attain a fast convergence speed.

The authors have also tried larger $Q$ (e.g., 5,10,15,20) in the proposed experiments, where the authors find that the final test accuracy remains the same but the convergence is dramatically slow. Therefore, the proposed algorithms are robust to $Q$ in terms of the test accuracy, but a smaller $Q$ chosen from 1 to 5 is preferred in practice to attain fast convergence.

The original paper by Chow and Liu [1] has 3000+ citations and their algorithm has been used for numerous applications in a wide variety of scientific fields. Recent work [2, 3] has shown that the Chow-Liu algorithm is the optimal algorithm for estimating tree-structured distributions. This leads to a natural question: Is Chow-Liu the optimal algorithm for estimating an important statistic of a tree-structured distribution, such as its entropy? the proposed work shows that the answer, surprisingly, is “no”. The authors show that the Chow-Liu algorithm requires $\\Omega(d^2)$ pairwise samples to estimate Shannon entropy, while the proposed algorithm requires only $O(d)$ pairwise samples.\n2. In lines 29 - 34 the authors described wearable health-monitoring devices as a natural application for private and distributed entropy estimation. Another application is fingerprinting detection on the web [4]. Many websites track users without their consent by recording information about their devices, a practice called fingerprinting. Entropy is the standard metric used to quantify the identifiability of the collected fingerprints. So a private and distributed method for estimating entropy can be used by a browser to warn users that this covert tracking is occurring, without ever storing the fingerprints themselves. This approach has been proposed by Google Chrome [5]\n3. In NeurIPS 2021, the authors of [6] posed an open problem: Is there a non-interactive private algorithm for estimating Gini entropy with sample complexity that has no dependence on the support size of the distribution?

Сonsidering truncated versions of each baseline is essential to demonstrate that using the same budget MemUP allows RNNs to learn long-term dependencies, while baselines decline in performance. \nUsually RNNs and Transformers cannot learn temporal dependencies if they never fit inside a single rollout during training ( as can be seen in the proposed experiments). MemUP training allows RNNs to learn temporal dependencies using shorter rollouts. Shorter rollouts save computational space usage ( all intermediate activations inside a single rollout need to be stored). Therefore, the authors specifically focus on showing that MemUP allows RNNs to learn with shorter rollouts. MemUP can be easily used with longer rollouts (the authors will include experiments with rollout length of 500 and 1000 in the Supplementary Materials).

(The authors denote $\\mathcal{L}_K$ as the terms of KL-divergence in the original equation.)\n\n- $\\mathcal{L}_p$ and $\\mathcal{L}_K$ are common terms in ELBO for VAE, where the former is used to calculate the prediction error between the output of the encoder and the target, and the latter is used to regularize the pattern in latent space. The authors used $\\mu$ to match the two terms to the same scale.\n- The authors adopt the assumption of graph signals that values change smoothly across adjacent nodes. So the Dirichlet energy $\\Omega(\\mathbf{A},\\mathbf{X})$ (Equation 10) maps the graph representation $\\mathbf{G} = (\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{X})$ to a line, so that the connected points stay as close together as possible [3]. The authors used $\\alpha$ to match the $\\Omega$ to the same scale of $\\mathcal{L}_p$.\n- The connectiveness term $\\mathcal{L}_d$ has the purpose to ensure that each node has at least one edge with another node. (The result of $\\mathbf{Z}\\mathbf{1}$ is the node degree vector.) The authors use the logarithmic barrier to force the degrees to be positive, but not prevent edges from becoming zero. The authors used $\\beta$ to match the $\\mathcal{L}_d$ to the same scale of $\\mathcal{L}_p$.\n- However, adding the logarithmic term in $\\mathcal{L}_d$ leads to very sparse graphs, and changing its weight in the loss ($\\beta$) only changes the scale of the solution and not the sparsity pattern. For this reason, the authors added the third term $\\mathcal{L}_s$. Yet it was mentioned in [18] and observed by us that adding an $\\ell$-1 norm to control sparsity was not very useful. So the authors chose the Frobenius norm, which penalized the big values but not the smaller ones. This leads to a more dense adjacency matrix for a bigger value of $\\gamma$.\n\nThe authors also showed the count of indirect connections with different path lengths in Figure 4. During experiments, they firstly scaled the various terms in the hybrid loss to the same scale. Then they found the different values of the weights of the regularization terms in hybrid loss had a minor effect, and the number of indirect connections in the learned adjacency matrices had only a minor difference.

The best evidence of this is that their system works well not only for the L96 experiments in the main paper, but also for the KS experiments in the supplement with minimal adjustments. In contrast, it is not at all clear how to set an objective function for the KS setting without expert knowledge.\nThere is no simple parametric form for objective functions, so choosing a good objective function is generally more complex than hyperparameter tuning. The system, while complex, was tuned over a small number of values for a small number of hyperparameters, all of which could be set reasonably well using reasonable heuristics. For example, the framework was developed using the L96 system; then applied to the KS system, and the only change required was altering the embedding dimension.\n\nMore specifically, this architecture uses a ResNet backbone -- a well-known powerful network suited to many downstream tasks in computer vision, especially for contrastive representation learning. Its efficacy in varied settings suggest it is a good, general-purpose backbone that would not need to be redesigned for a new parameter estimation problem due to its representation power for complex and dynamic data. And the authors can easily adjust the size of the Resnet to correspond to the dimensionality of the data.\nSecond, the dimensionality of the latent embedding is generally chosen in an empirical way using grid search, a simple heuristic is to set it to be $8, 12$, or  $16$ times the number of dimensionality of $\\boldsymbol{\\phi}$. The rationale behind this rule is that, under a few assumptions (see in Section A.2), the embedding of the learned contrastive representation would be an affine transformation $A$ (with full column rank) of the inverse of the data generating process $H^{-1}(\\mathbf{Z})$ [Zimmermann et al., 2021]. \nTherefore, setting the embedding dimension a few times larger than the parameter dimension will be enough to approximate the inverse mapping $A^{-1}$. Similarly, the dimensionality of latent space is always selected empirically between $\\{128, 256, 512\\}$ and is normally set to be a bit larger than the input and output dimension. Third, only two important hyperparameters arisen with contrastive representation learning are temperature value $\\tau$, number of negative samples (memory bank size). As discussed in Section B.1 from line 630 to 638, temperature values balance the influence between barely (hard) and easily (easy) distinguishable. The heat-up strategy of Zhang et al. [2018] was adopted, start with a low $\\tau'$, monitor the decrease of the training loss, and linearly increase $\\tau'$ toward the end of training to add impacts of ``easy'' samples. Lastly, set the number of negative samples to be as large as possible to ensure better empirical performance [Wang and Isola, 2020]."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Using backpropagation, could CVNNs learn different hypotheses with RVNNs? It is very difficult to answer. Over the past thirty years, due to limitations of technical tools and understanding of deep neural networks, despite many empirical studies, it is hard, or even intractable, to analyze the training dynamics of neural networks theoretically.\n\nSecond, about the overparameterization: By generalizing NTK theory to the complex domain, the authors give a theoretical answer to this fundamental question in an asymptotic sense (infinite width). The authors prove the asymptotic equivalence between CVNNs and RVNNs using real-valued BP under most commonly used activation functions.

In its design, GTD corrects only the mismatch between behavior and target policy, via the policy ratio $\\pi(a|s)/\\pi_b(a|s)$ (where $\\pi(a|s)$ is target policy), but doesn’t correct the distribution mismatch of $D(s)$. This is not sufficient, because the authors not only need to correct the policy but also need to correct the behavior sampling distribution $D(s)$. \nIn contrast, the proposed GenTD correct the entire $P_D(s,a)=D(s)\\pi_b(a|s)$ to $P_\\pi(s,a) = \\mu_\\pi(s)\\pi(a|s)$ (where $\\mu_\\pi(s)$ is the stationary distribution under target policy $\\pi$) via learning the density ratio $\\rho(s,a) = P_\\pi(a|s)/P_D(s,a)$.

For dynamic graphs, the authors define invariant patterns as subsets of ego-graphs across time stamps whose predictivity to labels are stable across time periods and graph communities. Here the authors also provide some conceptual examples. In road networks, for example, two traffic jams in different places and times may happen simultaneously by chance or there can be causal relations, e.g., the road structure let one traffic jam to block other roads and inevitably lead to another traffic jam. Only the latter case forms invariant patterns and can be used for stable predictions. Take recommendation systems for another example. Users' purchase of a sequence of items may be correlational or there can exist stable and invariant patterns, e.g., first buy a main product and then buy the accessories of the main product. In the case study shown in Appendix C.5, the authors show that DIDA can summarize invariant patterns in the temporal and neighborhood structure to capture the users' interests in shopping and make predictions of future interactions by matching the summarized recent interests, leading to better generalization abilities."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Object arrangement is not limited to the room scenario. For instance, in multi-agent formation control, the UAV/UGV are required to move together to form a pattern in the shortest path. The proposed ball arrangement tasks are exactly inline with this real-world scenario.\n\nThe reason why the authors further evaluate the proposed method in a room scenario is that the authors would like to show the proposed method can handle more observational variables, e.g., orientation, object size, and category. Inspired by the multi-chair arrangement example in the proposed demo video, the authors enable all objects to be moveable to simplify the dynamics so as to emphasize the key difficulty of the arrangement task.\n\n**Object arrangement task is an underexplored problem.** To emphasize the key difficulty of this problem, the authors evaluate the proposed method in controlled environments with fewer variants. This research paradigm is common in machine learning communities. Also, a concurrent work for arrangement study in ICML [1] adopts a similar research paradigm.

The over-smoothing phenomenon is that nodes lose their original attribute information in the representations, thus become indistinguishable from each other. As claimed by pervious works, the over-smoothing issue is caused by repeatedly propagating node attribute via topology-wise weights, e.g., node degree in Eq. (11). The proposed OPEN represents node via its corresponding ego-network modeling, which is equivalent to refining the propagation weight via the ego-network’s attribute, thus alleviates the degradation and the over-smoothing. Theorem 1 demonstrates that node representation obtained from OPEN is relevant to the principal components of its corresponding ego-network’s attribute, thus they can be distinguished from each other. Therefore, OPEN can alleviate over-smoothing issue by refining the propagation weights via the ego-network’s attribute."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Therefore, the authors have reason to believe that there is a certain consistency of results between the two criteria because the samples whose average feature norm is small but feature norm on individual channels is large are minorities.\n(2) Performance analysis: Since the proposed approach of using absolute mean to obtain magnitude has already achieved similar performance as the baseline, the authors think that even adding those outliers (those features with very large values on some specific channels) will not increase the performance any further."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

R3M: A Universal Visual Representation for Robot Manipulation. arXiv 2022.", "reference_answer": "A: **MVP paper**: MVP uses self-supervised pretraining on images collected online and is tested on a new suite of control tasks proposed by the authors. The main differences are: \n- VRL3 considers the combination of **non-RL data, offline RL, and online RL data**. This paper only studies how non-RL data can be combined with online RL. \n- VRL3 work can be seen as **a more general** framework in the sense that if the authors remove stage 2 training of VRL3, set encoder learning rate to 0, and switch to a different dataset and pretraining method in stage 1, then the authors arrive at the MVP framework. \n- **Novel results** found in VRL3 paper are not covered by the MVP paper: VRL3 authors provide a comprehensive study on the effect of enabling/disabling encoder training in different stages, and discuss how it can be finetuned in a stable and effective manner, the authors discuss how self-supervised learning in stage 2 might be entirely unnecessary when offline RL updates are used, etc.\n- One of the proposed major contributions is a new SOTA performance on the popular and challenging Adroit benchmark. MVP **does not** study this benchmark. MVP also does not benchmark against prior SOTA algorithms in robotic control such as RRL and FERM (figure 5 of MVP paper). \n\n**PVR paper**: an interesting paper that combines pretrained encoders and imitation learning. The main differences are: \n- VRL3 paper is focused on combine encoder pretraining with offline and online **RL**, while PVR studies how pretraining is combined with **imitation learning**. \n- VRL3 work can be seen as **a more general** framework in the sense that if the authors disable stage 3 training of VRL3, set encoder learning rate to 0, enable BC training in stage 2, and switch to a different pretraining method in stage 1, then the authors arrive at the PVR framework. \n- **Novel results** found in VRL3 paper are not covered by the MVP paper: for example, VRL3 authors show that imitation learning (behavioral cloning) in stage 2 can be entirely removed when proper offline RL updates are applied, etc. \n- PVR has tested on the Adroit environment, they use more demonstrations than us (100 demos in PVR, while VRL3 authors use the standard 25 demos), and their performance is **lower than ours** (they achieve an average of 85% success rate, shown in Figure 1 of PVR paper, while the authors reach 95% or higher). \n- Pretraining excluded, PVR reports a wall-clock training time of 8-24 hours (appendix A.5 of PVR paper), while VRL3 authors report 1.6-13.3 hours (an average of 5.57 hours, see appendix B.3 (page 34) of the proposed work) training time to reach a stronger performance, which is **much faster**. \n\n**R3M paper**: similar to the PVR paper, they combine pretrained encoder (using a more sophisticated pretraining method) and imitation learning. The differences are similar to when the authors compare VRL3 and PVR. Performance-wise, R3M reports a <70% success rate on the Adroit benchmark, **weaker than** the proposed 95% success rate. In terms of computation efficiency, it is not reported in the R3M paper.\n\nHowever, the performance of above works on Adroit is weaker than the proposed method's results. Based on these results, it seems the proposed work is indeed the first successful framework that achieves a new SOTA performance on pixel-input Adroit while utilizing a combination of non-RL, offline RL and online RL data.

The reviewer is right that by randomly sampling the point cloud, even dropping 30% of the points will not have a major impact on the classification accuracy. The goal of the referenced work [1] is to maintain the classification accuracy by sampling the point cloud. However, the proposed point dropping is conducted in an **adversarial** manner using the method proposed in [2]. The adversary tries to drop the most influential points with regard to the classification accuracy. [2] shows that with 200 dropped points, the remaining point cloud can even fool human perception. Therefore, the authors restrict the threat model to be capable of dropping 100 points to not affect human perception of the remaining point clouds.\n[1] Lang, Itai, Asaf Manor, and Shai Avidan. \"Samplenet: Differentiable point cloud sampling.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2020.\n[2] Zheng, Tianhang, et al. \"Pointcloud saliency maps.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2019."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

However, it should be noted that NIERT has core differences from vanilla Transformer:\n  1. The main component of NIERT only has an encoder.\n  2. The authors modified self-attention to partial self-attention in this Transformer encoder to meet the inductive bias of interpolation.\n\nthe authors interpret the proposed NIERT via a tight connection with the classical RBF approach. Let's have a look first at the formalizations of these two approaches which are listed below:\n\n  - _RBF_: RBF interpolation formulates the interpolant as \n    $$f(x)= \\sum_j\\lambda_j\\phi(x,x_j)\\tag{1}$$\n    where $\\phi(x,x_j)$ is the radial basis function related to the observed point $x_j$ and $\\lambda_j$ is the coefficient.\n\n  - _NIERT_: In the core mechanism of NIERT, namely partial self-attention layer, a point $x_i$'s representation $\\tilde{v}_i$ is computed by\n    $$\\tilde{v}_i = \\sum_j\\alpha(q_i,k_j)v_j\\tag{2}$$\n    where $\\alpha(q_i,k_j)$ is the normalized attention weight function. $\\alpha(q_i,k_j)$ models the corelation between any query vector $q_i$ and key vector $k_j$ ($k_j$ is related to an observed point $x_j$).\n    \n  the authors can easily find that Eq.(2) is a general form of Eq.(1) by corresponding $\\alpha(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ to $\\phi(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ and $v_j$ to $\\lambda_j$. Thus, by enhancing with other mechanisms, such as layer normalization, skip connection and multi-head mechanism, and applying supervised training, it is promising to obtained a high-accuracy and generalizable neural interpolator.\n\nThe above deep connection is one of the origins of the proposed idea. Another origin of the proposed idea is that masked language model like BERT, which can predict missing tokens based on some given tokens in a sentence, which resembles interpolation problem.\n\nthe authors think the tight connection between the proposed NIERT and RBF interpolation is also instructive.

As for the batch size, FixMatch uses **1024** and the authors use **32** due to the computational resource limitation. All these factors together contribute to the inconsistency of the results. These parameter settings are introduced in Table 4 in the proposed appendix, as well as in their papers. However, despite the hyperparameter differences, **the comparison between FixMatch and FlexMatch within the proposed codebase under the same condition is still fair**, and the performance improvement is noticeable.

The authors find that introducing auxiliary domains consistently improves performance in compression and generation tasks. Since real data is never perfectly self-similar, introducing the ability to \"extract\" common patterns across images as auxiliary domains for the Collage iterations makes the method more robust to a wider range of datasets compared to standard fractal compression.

Training the model without any single objective leads to inferior performances on downstream tasks. The E2E, E2R, and G2E loss promote the model from different perspectives by focusing on semantic understanding of concepts, complicated relations between entities, and structural information.

Admittedly, the authors do not reach a conclusion on how to determine the exact timing to start mask training. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept (which the authors will clarify in the next version), the above finding still has its own values: It suggests that the efficiency of the entire training and pruning process can be improved in terms of the duration of full model fine-tuning, which can **serve as a useful reference for the design of SRNet searching algorithm**. Moreover, it is worth noting that, to improve the efficiency of SRNet searching, the authors can at least directly start pruning on the pre-trained BERT, which is much more efficient than fully fine-tuning and can still produce SRNets at 50% sparsity (as shown by the results of Sec.3.4.2).

The rationale  behind the sharp decline in modularity is as follows: during economic turmoils or crisis, it's common that there will be a panic sell-off  in the market, i.e., many investors look to sell their whole portfolio of stocks in order to avoid losses. This sell-off drives prices  of almost all the stocks down, which then creates correlations between stocks from seemingly distinct sectors. Those additional correlations between stocks (nodes) from different sectors (classes) reduce the value of modularity because now the nodes within each sector will be less \nclustered. The authors noticed that the proposed method captures this natural behavior of the markets, therefore the authors conclude that the proposed method offers  a more realistic estimation of the network of stocks.

Thus the authors explore the problem of masking semantic meaningful patches (i.e., visual analogue of words) in MIM. \n\n*The relationship between the idea and the masking strategy:* Once the authors obtained part segmentations, a most intuitive way to validate the proposed idea is to mask a portion of semantic parts. However, as the learned semantic parts are coarse-grained (e.g., 6 parts for each image), it is too hard to directly reconstruct the masked parts. To this end, the authors design a masking strategy that can gradually guide the network to learn from intra-part patterns to inter-part relations (i.e., parts reconstruction).\n\n*Other related tasks:* There are several tasks that can be used to explore the visual analogue of words, e.g., multimodal understanding tasks and multimodal generation tasks.

This is equivalent to using the Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ to maximize the objective function $ I( \\hat{u*}; m) - \\beta  I( \\hat{u*}; o)$. Intuitively, as the first term is to encourage $m$ to be predictive of $\\hat{u*}$ while the second term is to encourage $m$ to forget $o$. Essentially $m$ is to act like a minimal sufficient statistic of $o$ for predicting $\\hat{u*}$ [1].\nThen specifically for each agent $i$, the authors intend to encourage assistive information$m_{-j}$  from other agents to agent $j$ to memorize its $\\hat{u_j*}$ when assistive information from agent $i$ is conditioned on observation $o_{j}$, \nwhile the authors encourage assistive information $m_i$ from agent $i$ to not depend directly on its own observation $o_i$. Then the authors have the definition of assistive information generation as eq(2). Following [2], the authors have a neural network to generate such assistive information with the objective as the evidence lower bound derived from it in appendix A1.1. \nNote in this specific task $o$ is not at a higher dimension of information compared to $\\hat{u*}$, thus a small $\\beta$ can be used as the authors described in the appendix when listing hyper-parameters used."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Because the attention mechanism assigns continuous weights to both positive and negative instances in positive bags, it is not best suited for instance label prediction under the standard multi-instance assumption. The proposed TargetedMIL algorithm integrates max-pooling with the evidence lower bound to learn an encoder-decoder model with identifiable causal representations, and the identified causal representation makes instance label prediction easier while benefiting model robustness.

Rigid 6-DoF poses are used for the registrations. The authors will clarify that in the paper.\n\nTo give you a full picture, imagine an autonomous vehicle is moving through the world and sampling point clouds using a lidar sensor. Lidar point clouds are generally sparse, and often one wants to accumulate/densify a set to draw more geometrical information. Therefore the authors can register/align consecutive point clouds into a single frame. If the world is rigid, the authors can use the ICP algorithm for the pair-wise rigid registration (*i.e*., find the rigid 6-DoF pose that best aligns one point cloud against another). However, if the scene is dynamic and there are a lot of movers (*i.e*., moving pedestrians and/or vehicles), if the authors were to apply ICP the authors would see a \"rolling shutter effect\" (a smearing effect) on the dynamic objects. This effect is demonstrated in the front car in the middle row of Figure 7, where the authors used simple rigid 6-DoF poses to register the point clouds rigidly.\nOn the other hand, scene flow gives a per-point transformation (*i.e*., a translational vector) that allows for non-rigid registration. Thus, reducing the smearing effect because the rigid and non-rigid parts of the scene are correctly registered/accumulated. \n\n> **Regarding minor comments.**\n1.

In particular, the authors computed the entropy of normalized scores GStarX output for each graph, and then averaged the entropy over each dataset. To understand how sparse these results are, the authors pick three distributions as references. 1) The entropy of uniform distribution over all n nodes in a graph, i.e., Uniform(n), which represents the least sparse output and is an upper bound of entropy-based sparsity as pointed out in the ZORRO paper. 2) The entropy of uniform distribution over the top 25% nodes in a graph, i.e., Uniform(0.25n), where probabilities of the bottom 75% nodes are set to zero. This case is very sparse since 75% of nodes are deterministically excluded, which can be treated as a practical lower bound of the entropy-based sparsity. 3) The entropy of Poisson distribution with mean 0.25n, i.e. Poisson(0.25n). This is a more realistic version of the sparse outputs in case 2). Instead of setting all 75% of nodes to have probability zero, the authors assume the probabilities for tail nodes decrease exponentially as a Poisson distribution while the mean is kept the same as in case 2). \n\nIn the table below, the authors show the average entropy-based sparsity of GStarX outputs vs. these three reference cases on each dataset. The authors see that the GStarX sparsity is between Uniform(0.25n) and Uniform(n) and is close to Poisson(0.25n), which justifies that GStarX outputs are indeed sparse.

As discussed in the caption of Figure 2, authors plot the normalized MIWs whose mean on the entire dataset is 1.

In particular, in Figure 3, it is observed that for the DualDICE variant, the distribution of MIW on the entire dataset gradually degenerates on very small and very large values.

For DETR-based approaches, the authors observed that object queries tend to sparsely focus on specific local regions in the image, so it is relatively hard for object query to capture enough receptive field for large objects. As discussed in R1-Q5, the fixed coding length of object query also constraints the representation power for large objects. Therefore, longer/dynamic coding length of queries maybe developed to adapt various sized objects.

Why do the authors take different metrics in this work? ", "reference_answer": "A: Yes, the authors did not take the same metrics as DVG-Face due to the differences in the generation method and the training process.\n* Even though DVG-Face can generate multiple pairs of NIR-VIS images for a particular identity, it only generates one NIR-VIS pair per person. DVG-Face measures Mean Similarity (MS) between the pair to evaluate intra-identity consistency. However, the authors generate multiple NIR and VIS face images for a given identity. To obtain the intra-identity consistency, the feature distances (similarity) across multiple images are calculated, namely Mean Identity feature Distance (MID) in the proposed work. In the revision, for better understanding, the authors compare with DVG-Face on LAMP-HQ in terms of MS between pairs and MS across multiple images, which are indicated by 1v1 and 1vN, respectively. The results have been added to Table 2 in the revision. The results show that the proposed method outperforms DVG-Face by achieving higher MS on both settings, which proves the proposed generation well preserves intra-identity consistency. Additionally, the 1vN MS of the proposed method is 0.411. Given the general identity verification threshold (around 0.3), the proposed generation preserves the faces diversity.\n* DVG-Face obtains identity representations for the face generation via random noise sampling. The evaluation of inter-identity diversity via Mean Instance Similarity (MIS) proves the low overlap between generated identities. However, the identity features the authors used for the face generation come from a benchmark VIS face recognition dataset (CelebA). There is no overlap between identities. Thus, the authors did not evaluate MIS in the proposed work. In the revision, the authors add the comparison results on MIS in Table 2. Following the settings in DVG-Face, the comparisons are conducted between VIS-VIS pairs and NIR-VIS pairs. The results suggest that the proposed generation achieves a higher inter-identity diversity than DVG-Face.\n* Frechet Inception Distance (FID) is widely used in GAN-based generation, but the authors use physical rendering based generation. Following DVG-Face, the authors also employed LightCNN for FID evaluation in the revision. The proposed method exhibits higher feature distribution consistency with real data than the GAN-based DVG-Face. Even though the proposed method has not rendered hair and torso, the proposed generation is more close to the feature of real data from the view of a face recognition network."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

[1], Liu et al. [2], and Pang et al. [3] also conduct point cloud pre-training via masking, which are ***concurrent works*** to ours, but use different strategies for masked modeling.\nComparison to Fu et al. [1]:\nA: 1) **Different pre-training strategies.** Following Point-BERT, [1] utilizes BERT-style pre-training. It is not a masked autoencoder (MAE) and different from the proposed MAE-style pre-training. Such BERT style predicts the masked token encoded by an independently trained tokenizer, while the proposed MAE style directly reconstructs the masked points' raw 3D coordinates, which is simpler and more efficient. \n2) **Less self-supervisory signals.** [1] consists of two complicated losses, a masked modeling loss and a contrastive loss for different sub-sets of point clouds. The proposed Point-M2AE only requires the simple reconstruction loss and achieves better performances.\nComparison to Liu et al [2]\nA: 1) **Different pre-training strategies.** [2] proposed a masked discrimination (MD) pre-text task that conducts binary classification to judge if a point token is masked. It adopts binary focal loss for self-supervision and is different from the proposed MAE-style pre-training that reconstructs masked coordinates.\nComparison to Pang et al [3]\nA: 1) **Hierarchical architectures.** [3] also adopts MAE-style pre-training but utilizes a plain transformer-like 2D MAE without 3D specific modifications. The proposed Point-M2AE adopts a hierarchical encoder-decoder with skip connections and local attention to better capture local-to-global 3D geometries. \n2) **Multi-scale Masking strategy.** [3] adopts the vanilla random masking, but the authors introduce a multi-scale masking to generate consistent visible region across scales. It can largely boosts the performance as shown in Table 7 of the main paper (88.4 $\\rightarrow$ 92.9 for Linear SVM on ModelNet40).\nVisual interpretation of local spatial attention in ablation study.\nA: the authors visualize the attention weights with and without the local attention in ***Figure 5 of the newly-revised supplementary material.*** As shown in the figure, with the local attention, the query point (marked by star) only has large attention values within a local spatial range (marked by yellow dotted circles), other than scattering over the entire 3D shape (marked by yellow arrows).

The authors do not require the *objective* to be geodesically convex but only need the {$A_t$} (manifold valued variables) in Prop. 4 to lie inside a geodesic ball of radius less than the convexity radius. This assumption is standard for manifold based statistical models due to the presence of varying sectional curvature [1,7,9]. Please let us know if this clarifies the doubt. \n\nBounded gradient: The objective functions, $\\widetilde{F}$ and $\\widetilde{F}_{pca}$ are Lipschitz continuous as the population covariance matrices are assumed to be bounded. This implies that the Euclidean gradient is bounded, and as the Riemannian covariant derivative is upper bounded by the Euclidean gradient, the authors can conclude that a constant to bound gradient in Proposition 4 exists. In practice, this step does not lead to numerical issues in the proposed implementation. \n\nBounded iterates: This is derived directly by \"inverting\" the specified tolerance level. The proposed objective is defined using a finite sum. Since the authors use a stochastic algorithm, the number of iterations sufficient to reach the tolerance level is based on using the error on iteration $t$ (used in showing the convergence rate) and solving for $t$. In order to get $\\epsilon$ tolerance, the authors need a number of iterates bounded by $O(N + D/\\epsilon^2)$ for some constant $D > 0$ which depends on Lipschitz constant for the objective function and the sectional curvature bound of the underlying manifold (denoted by $\\kappa$ in Proposition 4).

They often use similar training recipes for SuperNets as in ImageNet-trained models (e.g., MobileNet, RegNet) for task-specific optimization with accuracy as an evaluation metric. \nIn contrast, **AutoDistil training is fully task-agnostic** and does not access task labels during SuperNet training. Different from CV domain, NLP tasks have different objectives and evaluation metrics for classification (e.g., MNLI), regression (e.g., STS-B) and correlation (e.g., CoLA). \n\n**(ii) Fully task-agnostic training objective.**\nIn view of the above, the proposed SuperNet training objective leverages self-attention distillation which is unsupervised and does not require task labels or additional training. In contrast, for downstream task adaptation, existing NAS works in NLP (e.g., DynaBERT, NASBERT, AutoTinyBERT) use additional expensive step(s) of further pre-training / distillation of the optimal architecture with task labels for best performance.\nIncorporating self-attention loss for SuperNet training and distillation in NAS is non-trivial. It requires aligning the attention states (query, key, value) of varying size subnetworks to that of the large teacher. The authors develop an extraction and alignment strategy (Section 3.2) to address this challenge. During sampling, the authors employ Sandwich rule (lines 173-176) to improve the performance of all subnetworks by increasing the performance lower bound (smallest subnetwork) and upper bound (largest one) across all subnetworks.\n\n**(iii) Single-stage training for computational savings.**\nIn contrast to prior works, the authors do a single-stage training combining NAS and distillation with no further pre-training or augmentation and demonstrate the superior performance of the NAS process itself. Obtained subnetworks are simply fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Table 3 demonstrates a massive reduction in search and additional training cost over state-of-the-art NAS work (AutoTinyBERT) on NLP tasks.\n\n**(iv) One-shot vs. Few-shot NAS.** \nIn contrast to prior NAS works in the NLP domain (e.g., DynaBERT, AuotTinyBERT, NASBERT) that employ a single large search space (One-shot NAS), the authors demonstrate the value of sub-space partitioning to reduce gradient conflicts and optimization interference for improved performance with Few-shot NAS design and ablation analysis."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For Linf to Linf, L2 to Linf, and Linf to L2, the computed expansion function slope scales with the square root of the dimension of the input, so the predicted slope becomes meaningless for high dimensional data such as CIFAR-10.  However, the authors provide results based on your suggestion of linear approximation for L2 source to L2 target for which the predicted slope is independent of input dimension.  Specifically, the authors do the following:\n\nFor each ResNet-18 model (used for plotting empirical expansion function):\n\n- For each test point, take the local approximation of the model around that test point and compute the condition number of this approximation\n- Average all computed local condition numbers to obtain a condition number for the model\n- Take the maximum out of all model condition numbers to approximate $B$, the upper bound on condition number for the hypothesis class\n- Estimate expansion function slope via $B\\frac{\\epsilon_1}{\\epsilon_2}$\n\nA: Doing this, the authors find that the estimated $B$ ends up being very large (B=224334), so the predicted expansion slope also ends up being much larger than found empirically (448668 vs 1.14).  Thus with the current theoretical results, the authors do not have a good explanation for why the authors observe linear expansion functions for neural networks.  This however would make an interesting direction for future research."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The authors explain this in Line 185-202. In short, the learnable set is derived by the expressiveness of the corresponding NTK with infinite width. If a function is learnable, then it at least should be able to be expressed by an infinite width NTK (more neurons usually mean stronger expressiveness). Therefore, the authors believe those expressible functions are the only reasonable candidates of learnable functions. The authors then use Theorem 1 to prove that those functions can indeed be learnt (i.e., the generalization error goes to zero under ideal situation). The authors note that similar definition of learnable sets has been used in [Ju et al '21] for 2-layer NTK without bias. Specifically, [Ju et al '21] shows that, for 2-layer NTK without bias, if a function is at a positive distance away from the learnable set derived from expressiveness, then a lower bound can be provided to show that the test error of the min $\\ell\\_2$-norm overfitted solution will not go to zero even when there is no noise and when $n,p\\to \\infty$.

Traditional works on task-agnostic knowledge distillation target a specific compressed model architecture. However, it is non-trivial to obtain a combination of the above. For instance, task-agnostic self-attention distillation for SuperNet training and distillation with NAS requires aligning the attention states (query, key, value) of varying size subnetworks to that of the large teacher. The authors develop an extraction and alignment strategy (Section 3.2) to address this challenge. During sampling, the authors employ Sandwich rule (lines 173-176) to improve the performance of all subnetworks by increasing the performance lower bound (smallest subnetwork) and upper bound (largest one) across all subnetworks.\n\nFurther, existing NAS works in NLP (e.g., DynaBERT, NASBERT, AutoTinyBERT) use additional expensive step(s) of further pre-training / distillation of the optimal architecture with task labels for best performance. In contrast, the proposed single-stage task-agnostic method without additional training offers massive reduction in computational cost for training and search (see Table 3). \n\nCompared with DynaBERT, (i) the proposed search space is more fine-grained. For instance, the authors independently search for width, depth, heads, MLP ratio etc. as opposed to searching for a constant depth ($m_d$) or width multiplier ($m_w$) in DynaBERT which only considers $12$ possible combinations of $m_d$ and $m_w$; (ii)  the proposed training objective does not require labels and is fully task-agnostic with subnetwork attention state alignment for self-attention relation distillation; (iii) further, AutoDistil uses few-shot NAS (Table 1) to mitigate gradient conflicts in SuperNet training, while DynaBERT applies one-shot NAS; (iv) DynaBERT uses additional tricks like data augmentation and teacher assistant also specific to each task, whereas AutoDistil uses a single-stage task-agnostic training resulting in reduced computational cost.\n\nTable 1 in the Appendix compares AutoDistil against all recent NLP works on NAS (e.g., DynaBERT, AutoTinyBERT, NASBERT) and Distillation (MiniLM, DistilBERT, MobileBERT, PKD).

The authors used ImageNet and LibriSpeech for the proposed non-linguistic datasets as they are commonly used and easily accessible labeled datasets. For both datasets the authors used around 30K samples. It is possible that careful cherry picking of the non-linguistic dataset could lead to improved performance, but that was not the objective of this paper. The advantage of not cherry picking the non-linguistic datasets is that the proposed framework can be easily applied without much additional cost. As the authors show in Section 4.5, ImageNet was fit for training in all languages that the authors experimented with (including an experiment on Chinese, showing that the proposed framework can work on non-European languages as well). In brief, the proposed experiments show that ImageNet should suffice as the non-linguistic dataset for all language training."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For the fidelity-oriented reward, it can be decomposed as: fidelity metric + SR. In the proposed experiment using model#16, the authors choose the nDTW [2] as the fidelity metric to design the fidelity-oriented reward. The authors compare the proposed two kinds of focal-oriented rewards with the fidelity-oriented reward (model#16, nDTW+SR) in Table 3 and analyzed the results in Section 6.2. The proposed soft focal-oriented reward outperforms nDTW+SR with 0.7% dropped on Loss Number (LN), and the proposed hard focal-oriented reward outperforms nDTW+SR with 1.8% dropped on LN and 1.3% improved on SR. In addition, the authors did not consider the CLS [1] metric in the paper because it is order-invariant and not ideal in some scenarios as described in [2]. For your reference, the proposed results using CLS+SR as the fidelity-oriented reward on Landmark-RxR (Val Unseen) are SA (56.4), SSA(32.3), LN (5279) and on en-RxR (Val Unseen) are nDTW (39.6), sDTW (24.5), SR (32.9). The proposed soft focal-oriented reward outperforms CLS+SR with 0.5% dropped on LN and 0.8% improved on SR, and the proposed hard focal-oriented reward outperforms CLS+SR with 1.7% dropped on LN and 2% improved on SR. \n[1] Vihan Jain, Gabriel Magalhaes, Alexander Ku, Ashish Vaswani, Eugene Ie, and Jason Baldridge.

For the convenience of implementation, here the term \"uncertainty\" is equated with the epistemic uncertainty [2], which can be quantified as the amount of relevant real-world data. Therefore, a region with more data is considered to have lower uncertainty. Since in pure online settings the uncertainty of regions is hard to control during the training iterations, the authors first pretrain the model with an offline dataset and then switch to online training. The goal is allocated to the grey region where the relevant offline samples are partially discarded. The percent of discarded samples is set to 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% respectively and the results are given as follows:\n\n|         |       25%       |      50%       |      75%       |      100%      |\n| :-----: | :-------------: | :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |\n| P2P-MPC | $148.9\\pm 35.9$ | $75.4\\pm 31.6$ | $51.7\\pm 29.8$ | $43.2\\pm 25.1$ |\n|  MBPO   | $116.2\\pm 35.6$ | $61.1\\pm 34.8$ | $47.5\\pm 35.1$ | $44.7\\pm 30.2$ |\n\nAs the degree of uncertainty increases, the performances of both methods degrade rapidly, but P2P-MPC still outperforms MBPO in all these cases except for the 100% case, where P2P-MPC achieves slightly worse performance in average but better stability with lower standard deviation. To give a possible explanation of these results, it is worth noting that 1) P2P does not directly intervene the learning of policy or value function, but only improves the accuracy of the generated samples. As a result, the value function can still predict high value for uncertain regions and thus encourage the policy to explore them in the real environment; and 2) in contrast, even if the goal is in a region with high uncertainty and the model does not prevent the policy from exploring this region in the model, the value function can still predict low value of this region due to the lack of relevant data and thus mislead the learning of policy.\n\n[1] Azar et al.

However, for natural image datasets such as human faces, a uniform distribution over the manifold is reasonable, because all human face images fall on a manifold restricted to a bounded region $\\left[0,255\\right]^{C\\times H\\times W}$ rather than extending to the entire infinite $\\mathbb{R}^{C\\times H\\times W}$ space, where $\\left[0,255\\right]$ is the range of pixel values and $C\\times H\\times W$ is the dimensionality of the image. Therefore, it is reasonable to adopt a uniform distribution on a finite manifold. In addition, it is subjective to adopt which kind of distribution over the support set. Although one may prefer some samples to others, the authors adopt the uniform distribution over the manifold because the authors take into account that every sample on the manifold can be equally accepted as a real image, which should also be acceptable."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The reason is this.

Unless it uses huge batch size in the order of $1/\\epsilon^2$, the BSGD algorithm does not converge. The proposed update here for the lower level variable $u$ uses stochastic gradient descent update, which can leverage the strong convexity of the lower level problem to enjoy diminishing error of the lower level update in the long term with respect to their optimal solutions (i.e., Lemma 2.4 in the paper). \n\nHu et al.

In this paper, the proposed BMU-MoCo and all the competitors are based on the same basic Base-MoCo with momentum encoders and queues. Under such fair setting, the authors evaluate the proposed BMU-MoCo by comparing it to all the competitors. Specifically, the authors have proposed two BMU-MoCo models, one only utilizes local momentum encoders and the other utilizes local+global momentum encoders: (1) For the former BMU-MoCo (local), it has already outperformed all the competitors with exactly the same architecture of Base-MoCo (i.e., without using any extra memory and dynamic networks).

Due to the data imbalance issue, CPL may generate low final thresholds for the tail classes according to equation 6. Such low thresholds allow noisy pseudo-labeled samples to be trusted and learned. This is known by observing the loss descent figure where the low-threshold classes have major fluctuations. FixMatch, on the other hand, fixes its threshold at 0.95 to filter out noisy samples. Such a fixed high threshold is not preferable with respect to both accuracies of hard-to-learn classes and overall convergence speed as explained in the proposed work, but since SVHN is an easy task, the model can easily learn the task and make high-confidence predictions, it becomes less problematic to set a high-fixed threshold. The two properties together contribute to the result that FixMatch performs slightly better than FlexMatch in several cases. And we’d like to mention again that the more challenging the task is, the more significant performance improvement the proposed method will bring, as reflected on the STL-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets.

This experiment was run on an A100 GPU with 40GB memory on AWS for a week (2 million gradient updates, including various checkpoints evaluation). The scalability with respect to the number of training instances is shown in Appendix C.5. The authors cannot extract more than 10K training instances from ImageNet due to the proposed hardware constraints. The proposed current codebase does not support distributed training, so the number of distilled images the authors can extract is bounded by the GPU memory the authors can use. This engineering problem can be solved using the KIP paper's distributed kernel computation framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034).\n\nUsing all the synthetic data points to compute the meta-gradient is a limitation of the current method since the matrix inversion dominates the time complexity in Equation 2, which is O(N^3). It is acceptable with a few thousand images but becomes extremely expensive with tens of thousands of images. An ad hoc solution to distill more data points is to split the whole dataset into groups, either by class or randomly, and perform independent distillation like in Section 5.1. This is also the standard practice for previous methods. However, the authors observe a performance drop when the authors use such a strategy since the independent distillation may generate redundant information or fail to capture the distinguishable features that can only be identified considering the whole dataset. This problem is caused by not optimizing all parameters jointly, which can be potentially addressed by better parameterizing the distilled data. For example, the authors can parameterize the distilled data using a neural network. In that case, the authors can use a subset of synthetic data to compute the meta-gradient and optimize all model parameters jointly.

In mentioned related works, their used sub-instructions are automatically obtained by heuristic rules, which are not precise enough and limit the navigation performance. This is the first paper to create sub-goal level human annotations for sub-instructions for the instructions in RxR, and makes meaningful contributions in terms of adding more fine-grained data to RxR dataset. In addition, the proposed experiments about fine-grained data are designed to demonstrate that the supervision from fine-grained and coarse-grained data can complement each other to improve the cross-modal alignment ability of the model itself. By contrast, although Hong et al. [1] and Zhu et al. [2] also use fine-grained data, both of them use the fine-grained data mainly for a “one by one” strategy but not to investigate the relationship between different granularity data and improve the cross-modal alignment ability of the navigation model itself. During validation, they segment a given instruction into several sub-instructions that are much easier to navigate and mainly focus on how to navigate these easy sub-instructions one by one for better performance. And the major differences between the proposed work and your mentioned previous ones [3, 4] are as follows.  \nOur focal-oriented rewards focus on addressing the local cross-modal alignment problem with fine-grained supervision, while prior works only pay attention to the global cross-modal alignment, like the global goal points (goal-oriented reward [5]) and global trajectory similarity (fidelity-oriented reward [3, 4]). In addition, the authors have made the desired comparisons in Table 3 (model#16). For the fidelity-oriented reward, it can be decomposed as: fidelity metric + SR. In the proposed experiment using model#16, the authors choose the nDTW [4] as the fidelity metric to design the fidelity-oriented reward. The authors compare the proposed two kinds of focal-oriented rewards with the fidelity-oriented reward (model#16, nDTW+SR) in Table 3 and analyzed the results in Section 6.2. The proposed soft focal-oriented reward outperforms nDTW+SR with 0.7% dropped on Loss Number (LN), and the proposed hard focal-oriented reward outperforms nDTW+SR with 1.8% dropped on LN and 1.3% improved on SR. In addition, the authors did not consider the CLS [3] metric in the paper because it is order-invariant and not ideal in some scenarios as described in [4]. For your reference, the proposed results using CLS+SR as the fidelity-oriented reward on Landmark-RxR (Val Unseen) are SA (56.4), SSA(32.3), LN (5279) and on en-RxR (Val Unseen) are nDTW (39.6), sDTW (24.5), SR (32.9). The proposed soft focal-oriented reward outperforms CLS+SR with 0.5% dropped on LN and 0.8% improved on SR, and the proposed hard focal-oriented reward outperforms CLS+SR with 1.7% dropped on LN and 2% improved on SR. \n[1] Vihan Jain, Gabriel Magalhaes, Alexander Ku, Ashish Vaswani, Eugene Ie, and Jason Baldridge.

While none of the previous text-conditioned shape generation papers report any editing with such 'conflicted' text prompts, the authors indeed tried editing with such texts during the proposed experiments. As a result, the model can sometimes generate a novel shape which is a hybrid of the conflicting attributes. For example, if the inputs are 'standard legs' and 'wheels', the model can generate a shape that looks like the last example in Figure 1 row 2, where the shape has wheels on standard legs. Most of the time, the model tends to choose one of the attributes. This could be due to the proposed model representing the shape as a probability distribution. Therefore, when the model is only conditioned on one attribute, the probability distribution is more narrow. When the model is conditioned on more than one attribute, the probability distribution widens out. The authors will add visualizations of editing with 'conflicted' text prompts in the supplementary material. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

The only difference between FC layer (basic element in MLP) and conv layer (basic element in CNN) is that FC layer can be treated as convolution with kernel size 1, while conv layer in CNN always have larger kernel size. As shown in Line 144 in original paper, the representation ability of binary FC and conv layer is related to the kernel size (N=C_in * K_h * K_w), and binary FC layer tend to have less representation ability due to the small kernel size and yields poor performance, as shown in the table below.\n\n|Network|Kernel Size|Performance drop|\n|-|-|-|\n|WaveMLP|1|22%|\n|ResNet-18|3|17%|\n|AlexNet|11 & 5|13%|\n\nNote that the larger the kernel size, the less performance drop between 1bit network and full-precision network. Thus, the authors need to increase the representation ability of MLP.\n\nIn order to make the representation ability of FC layer (1x1 conv) to be the same as conv layer (kxk conv), there are two different ways. The first is to increase the input channel. Note that output channels should also be scaled up in order to maintain the representation ability (RA) of the next FC layer (the number of output channel of current layer is the number of the input channel of next layer). Thus, the computational complexity (CC) will be drastically increased, as shown in the table below.\n\n||in_channel|out_channel|kernel_size|CC|RA|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|bi-FC layer|$C_{in}$|$C_{out}$|$1\\times1$|$1$|$1$|\n|bi-conv layer|$C_{in}$|$C_{out}$|$k\\times k$|$k^2$|$k^2$|\n|bi-FC layer with more channel|$k^2C_{in}$|$k^2C_{out}$|$1\\times1$|$k^4$|$k^2$|\n\nThus, the authors use multi-branch blocks to increase the representation ability while maintain the computational complexity, as shown below.\n\n||branch_num|in_channel|out_channel|kernel_size|CC|RA|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|bi-FC layer|$1$|$C_{in}$|$C_{out}$|$1\\times 1$|$1$|$1$|\n|bi-conv layer|$1$|$C_{in}$|$C_{out}$|$k\\times k$|$k^2$|$k^2$|\n|bi-FC layer with more channel|$1$|$k^2C_{in}$|$k^2C_{out}$|$1\\times1$|$k^4$|$k^2$|\n|bi-FC layer with more branches|$k^2$|$C_{in}$|$C_{out}$|$1\\times1$|$k^2$|$k^2$|\n\nThe intuition of downsampling block is simple. Original downsampling layers (Figure 3 left) occupy the OPs of the whole binary network, and directly binarize them yield severe performance drop. Thus, the authors separate the changing of spatial size and channel number with maxpooling and 1x1 conv, and reduce the OPs while keeping the performance."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

And the computation of entropy requires many examples. This is fine in [1] since the EBM there has the form of E(x) which only needs to generate images <em>unconditionally<em>, and the entropy can be estimated using all previous generated images x. In the proposed work, the proposed EBM are E(x,m,c) and E(x,m1,m2,c), and the authors need to generate the mask <em>conditionally<em>, e.g. generate mask m conditioned on the image x and label c. The entropy term would need to be a conditional entropy of m given x and c, where the pool of mask m should be different for each individual image x and label c. This requires, e.g. for each x, c, the authors generate over 100 masks to estimate the entropy which is computationally expensive, while currently the authors only need to sample 1 mask. Moreover, typically there are limited correct masks for a concept in an image, and encouraging diversity may not help the model identify the correct mask. In fact, the authors have tried empirically with keeping the entropy term and it results in a much worse accuracy, likely due to the above reason.

For example, age estimation aims to estimate the age of a given face image while image aesthetic assessment predicts the aesthetic score for an image. As many popular methods adopt a classification framework, there are two main challenges. First, treating ranks as independent class categories fails to grasp the ordinal property. Second, as the learned concepts are mainly derived from the training set, these approaches are prone to overfit and usually attain unsatisfactory performance. Since learning the rank concept from the image domain alone is prone to overfitting, the authors can leverage multimodal information to alleviate this issue. The human language contains rich semantic information and prior knowledge. The authors consider simultaneously borrowing the rank concept from the language domain. Specifically, each rank label is not only regarded as a class category but also linked to a sentence describing the corresponding rank, such as \"this person is 23 years old\". In this way, the proposed model not only learns the concept of ranks defined on the vision dataset but also exploits the common knowledge of rank in the language domain. Therefore the authors propose a language-powered paradigm for ordinal regression to alleviate the overfitting issue by associating each rank category with its language concept. Moreover, the authors propose to learn rank prompts to model the ordinal property."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Is it that this paper is using a better model pool or models with higher feature dimensions or moving backbones?", "reference_answer": "A: The authors think the idea of KIP is excellent. The spirit of the proposed method and KIP are similar as the authors both want to find a good approximation to the inner loop optimization. If you think more along this line and are familiar with NTK theory, you would likely come up with a similar idea. Indeed, KIP works well in certain cases (e.g., given enough computation resources, low-resolution images). \n\nHowever, KIP has several drawbacks that make it less practical. The authors show them in the decreasing order of significance below.\n- High computation cost: It requires thousands of GPU hours to perform a single experiment on low-resolution image datasets like CIFAR10. You can see more details in Appendix B of https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13034, and you can also learn more from the neural tangent library https://github.com/google/neural-tangents#cnn-with-pooling).\n- Poor Scalability: KIP can not scale well to high-resolution images (time complexity is O(d^2) if using convolutional neural networks with pooling layers, where d is the number of pixels) or many data points.\n- Discrepancy between finite-width neural networks: KIP uses analytical NTK to compute the meta-gradient, which assumes the neural network to be infinitely wide and operates in the kernel regime. However, a standard finite-width neural network does not satisfy these assumptions, and its training dynamic is quite complex. Training a finite-width neural network on the distilled data causes a significant performance drop in evaluation. \n- Architecture Constraints: Many modern architectures with a normalization layer (e.g., BatchNorm) do not have an analytical NTK expression. So, the set of model architectures that KIP can use is quite limited.\n\nA: There are three main components in the proposed method:\n- (1) Conjugate kernel using a wider neural network (higher feature dimension)\n- (2) Online model update (moving backbones)\n- (3) Model pool\n\nThe authors think all of them are important, but in decreasing order of significance. The authors also provide additional tricks to further improve the performance in Appendix D. \n\nA: The first component is the most crucial one, designed to approximate the inner loop optimization efficiently. Compared to NTK approximation in KIP, the proposed method is at least four orders of magnitude faster, which makes the proposed method practical. You can find more ablation studies regarding the significance of the architecture (e.g., width, depth, and normalization) in Appendix C.6. Note that KIP uses the infinite-wide neural network to compute the meta-gradient for the distilled data, which is indeed using a much wider neural network than ours.\n\nA: The second component (online model update) aims to take the neural network training dynamic into account, which can improve the performance on CIFAR100 1 Img/Cls by 2% (Appendix Figure 9(b)). Essentially, this component is designed to account for errors caused by linear approximation. The authors want to take the complex NN training dynamics into account and gather gradient information from all stages of training rather than just the initialization. (1) + (2) form the analogy of 1-step TBPTT. People generally think 1-step TBPTT is bad as it causes significant truncation errors. However, the kernel approximation elegantly addresses this problem as it is equivalent to training the last layer into convergence.\n\nA: The third component is a generalization of the iterative model reinitialization techniques, which can improve the performance on CIFAR100 1 Img/Cls by 1% (Appendix Figure 9(a)). A direct motivation of this design is observing the cyclic behavior of loss when using an iterative model reinitialization. It suggests that the iterative model reinitialization scheme wastes some computation when it overfits a particular training trajectory. Besides, from the perspective of meta-learning, it is always good to have a diverse meta-train task to learn a more generalized meta-parameter. Therefore, the authors use the \"model pool\" idea to provide diverse meta-training tasks. "}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For the earlier GNN explanation works like GNNExplainer, most of the datasets are synthetic and thus with ground truth available. For example, nodes in the motif graph in the BA2Motif dataset are treated as the ground truth while nodes in the BA graph are excluded from the ground truth. For those real datasets used more often in recent works like SubgraphX, the authors can’t apply AUC or accuracy because the authors don’t know the ground truth. Some strong baselines the authors compared to, e.g. the GraphSVX model, have achieved over 0.93 accuracy on all the synthetic datasets evaluated in the paper, but only achieve 0.77 accuracy on the real MUTAG dataset (among many existing works the only real dataset with ground truth available). The authors thus think that showing explainers can work well on real datasets is a much more challenging and meaningful task.

Technically, linear networks can be expressed by the product of a sequence of weight matrices, which guarantees good geometrical properties. Specifically, the effect of every linear activation function is just equivalently multiplying a real constant to the output. However, the loss surface within a cell of a nonlinear neural network does not have this property.\nThe authors take a one-hidden-layer network for example. Suppose the output of the hidden layer is $h(WX))$, where $X$ is the data matrix, $h$ is the activation function, and $W$ is the weight matrix. If $h$ is a linear function $h(x) = ax$, its effect is equivalently multiplying the constant a to every element of the matrix $WX$. However, when the activation h is a two-piece linear function which has slopes $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$, different elements in the matrix $WX$ can be multiplied by either one from $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$. Therefore, the authors cannot use a single constant to express the effect of this activation, and thus, even within the cell, a nonlinear network cannot be expressed as the product of a sequence of weight matrices. This difference ensures that the proofs of deep linear neural networks cannot be transplanted here.\nTo address this issue, the authors develop a non-trivial approach to prove that all local minima in a cell are globally optimal within the cell. Specifically, the authors prove this in two steps: (1) the authors prove that within every cell, the empirical risk $\\hat{\\mathcal R}$ is convex with respect to a variable $\\hat W$ mapped from the weights $W$. Therefore, the local minima with respect to the variable $\\hat W$ are also the global minima in the cell; and then (2) the authors prove that the local optimality is maintained under the constructed mapping. Specifically, the local minima of the empirical risk $\\hat{\\mathcal R}$ with respect to the parameter $W$ are also the local minima with respect to the corresponding variable $\\hat W$."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Both approaches have similarities, in the sense that they exploit a hierarchical decomposition of the task at hand in order to simplify the credit assignment problem in RL. However, the two methods also differ on several points. \n1) in MAXQ, the hierarchical sub-task decomposition must be given a priori by the user for each new task, and is set in stone with a limited depth, while in tree MDPs the decomposition holds by construction, and can be applied recursively for virtually infinite depths; \n2) in MAXQ, the subtasks are different (different reward and optimal policy), while in tree MDPs the reward remains the same; \n3) in MAXQ, each sub-task necessarily results in a series of consecutively processed states (e.g., AAABBBCC), while in tree MDPs the temporal processing order of states can vary, and switches between different sub-trees are allowed (e.g., AACBBAC); and \n4) in MAXQ, the resulting process is made Markovian by including the subtask stack K to the state S, while in tree MDPs the state S is sufficient to have the Markovian property.

While the proposed domain-specific iterative optimizers perform very well, standard solvers take a large number of iterations to match the network prediction. L-BFGS-B matches the Adam network after 500 iterations but slows down significantly before reaching the SIP network prediction. The authors believe that, given an unlimited optimization budget, both iterative solvers will eventually reach the accuracy of Adam and SIP, but will take many orders of magnitude longer.

However, InfoGraph will force the encoder to learn patch-level representations in a way where many patch-level representations sufficiently common/related with the graph-level representation so that the mutual information between the graph-level representation and all patch-level representations is maximized.

The authors also propose to estimate the backward transition matrix $T^{b}$ simultaneously, to act as $T^{-1}$. Then the authors can also build the consistency regularization. However, since the transition matrix is to model the noisy data generation process, each element in the transition matrix has its physical meaning. Specifically, the authors always maintain the forward and backward transition matrix ($T$ and $T^b$) be diagonally dominant column stochastic matrix. Therefore, directly computing $T^{-1}$ cannot satisfy this constraint, and the backward transition matrix $T^{b}$ will be different from $T^{-1}$. Most important, the newly computed backward transition matrix is worked as the regularization term aiming to maximize the volume of the clean class posterior probability. Also, through the consistency regularization term, the authors could make full use of the invertible relationship between these two matrices $T$ and $T^b$. Finally, it could encourage the estimated transition matrix to converge to the optimal solution."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

For a trajectory corresponding to the given instruction, some points are described simply, but some are described in great detail. These points have different importance to the VLN task. For example, when the agent is asked to follow the instruction \"keep going until you reach the vase\", it needs to pay more attention to the point near the vase but not the midway points which have almost no corresponding description in the instruction. More attention to the point near the vase helps the agent align the visual object better with the instruction.

The inspiration is borrowed from the feature space attack. Specifically, the authors have little knowledge to determine which perturbations can point (from the surrogate model) to the target model, making it challenging to alleviate the approximation error in the weight space. In contrast, the authors have the prior that samples with different labels should have distinguishable representations/features. Thus, the authors can leverage the prior knowledge to select preferred perturbations in the feature space, i.e., the authors prefer perturbations that can make representations/features of samples with different labels indistinguishable. Therefore, the authors design a min-max optimization to identify the \"worst'' model, and then make different image features obtained by the worst model indistinguishable. Consequently, the authors select a guide image for each source image and generate adversarial examples by perturbing the source image to make the guide and source images have the same/similar representation/features. \nInspired by the question, the authors are aware that how selecting a guide image is an exciting direction to improve the performance of lightweight black-box attacks further."}}, "state": {"gui-gpt-4o-2024-11-20": false}, "annotator": "scidqa"}

Indeed, \"kernel quadrature\" has also been used for meaning this sort of integration rule without weights (e.g., Fuselier et al [2014; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00211-013-0581-1 ] or basically most of the papers other than Bach [2] or DPP-based kernel quadratures [5, 6, 7]). So the word \"kernel quadrature\" used by Bach [2] or Belhadji et al [6] is more like choosing \"interpolation nodes\" (indeed Belhadji et al [7] uses the word \"kernel interpolation\" for the same problem), although \"kernel interpolation\" also has a slightly different meaning [Wilson and Nickisch, ICML 2015, http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/wilson15.html ].\nOne major difference (relevant to the proposed specific discussion here) is that for the latter case, where the authors only choose points (quadrature nodes), there seems to be no point in thinking about \"convex quadrature\" or \"approximation by a probability measure\" or whatever regarding the weights, as the authors have to change the proposed weights according to the weight functions. So from the viewpoint of \"kernel quadrature with weighting function\", the proposed method would look strange, though the authors want to emphasize that using discrete probability measures for approximating probability measures itself is quite common in the literature of numerical integration. Also, for the quadrature with weighing function, the authors additionally have to assume that the authors know the exact integration of e.g. (weighting function) * k(., x) or something, which is not a practical assumption. So the latter problem is good for theoretical assessment of whether the set of points well capture the distribution, but not generally leads to practical algorithms for the whole problem of \"kernel quadrature with weighting function\".

CARD is related to BNNs in providing stochastic output. However, BNNs deliver such stochasticity by modeling *epistemic* uncertainty, the uncertainty over network parameters $W$ (by placing a prior distribution over $W$) – this type of uncertainty is a **property of the model**. On the other hand, CARD does not model epistemic uncertainty, as it applies a deterministic deep neural network as its functional form; it is designed to model *aleatoric* uncertainty instead, which is a **property intrinsic to the data**. In Eqn. 2 of the mentioned paper, such aleatoric uncertainty is captured by the last term as $\\sigma^2$, which is a constant w.r.t. the network parameters $\\theta$ for the variational distribution of model parameter $W$, thus ignored during the optimization of $\\theta$. The new method proposed in this paper aims to model the aleatoric uncertainty by making $\\sigma^2$ as part of the BNN output (Eqn. 7); however, note that it still explicitly assumes $p(y|x)$ to be a Gaussian distribution, as the objective function is the negative Gaussian log-likelihood, thus its effectiveness in capturing the actual aleatoric uncertainty depends on the validity of such parametric assumption for $p(y|x)$.

The original goal of constrained Markov game is to maximize $V_0^{(m)}(\\pi)$ (i.e., social welfare) for each agent $m$ under the constraints $V_{j}^{(m)}(\\pi) \\ge c_j^{(m)}$ (i.e., incentive compatibility).

For example, the authors may select the CE that achieves the highest agents' average welfare $\\overline{V}(\\pi):=\\frac{1}{M}\\sum _ {m=1} ^ M V_0^{(m)}(\\pi)$, or select the CE that achieves the lowest inter-agent welfare variance $\\frac{1}{M}\\sum _ {m=1} ^ M [V_0^{(m)}(\\pi)-\\overline{V}(\\pi)]^2$, or select CE by considering both aspects.

How can we formulate hard constrains into expectation form?", "reference_answer": "A: Regarding the first question, for example, [2] formulates an anti-jamming wireless communication system as a constrained Markov game involving a legitimate transmitter and a jammer. Specifically, the state corresponds to how long has the transmitter get rid of the jammer. For the actions, the transmitter can select one of $K$ channels and a transmission rate to transmit message, and the jammer can select a channel and a power level to jam. \nMoreover, the jammer is subject to an average power constraint written as $\\mathbb{E} _ {\\pi}\\big[\\frac{1}{H}\\sum _ {h=1} ^ {H}C_h(s_h,a_h^{(1)},a_h^{(2)})\\big]\\le P_{avg}$, where $C_h$ denotes the power consumption of jammer at time slot $h$ (the authors made their notations consistent with ours). This constraint can be rewritten into the proposed standard form $\\mathbb{E} _ {\\pi}\\big[\\sum _ {h=1} ^ {H}r_{1,h}^{(2)}\\big]\\ge C_{\\max}-P_{avg}$ by defining a reward for the jammer as $r_{1,h}^{(2)}=C_{\\max}-C_h$, where $C_{\\max}$ is an upper bound of $C_h$.\nRegarding the second question, some additional hard constraints taking the deterministic form $r_{j,h}^{(m)}(s_h, a_h) \\ge c_j^{(m)}$ for some $h, m, s_h, a_h$, the proposed primal-dual algorithm can be extended to address them. To summarize the main idea, the above hard constraints can be translated into a set of linear equality constraints $\\pi_h^{(m)}(a_h|s_h)=0$ such that the violation $r_{j,h}^{(m)}(s_h,a_h)<c_j^{(m)}$ occurs for at least one $j$. These hard constraints can be rewritten into an expectation form by properly defining an auxiliary reward function. Moreover, the authors can adjust the proposed primal-dual algorithm to handle these additional equality constraints by introducing additional dual variables. \n[2] M. K. Hanawal, M. J.

How can the objective of learning redundant residual blocks be combined with the understanding that CNNs extract feature hierarchies?", "reference_answer": "A: (1) It is widely accepted that modern CNNs such as MobileNet and ResNet have multi-stage structure where sequential stages (usually different resolutions between stages and the same resolution in one stage) generate hierarchical representations. From this view, whatever the proposed sampling method, deleting and shuffling strategy, they don’t break the multi-stage structure, which means that the hierarchical structure of representations is reserved.\n(2) Moreover, [5] and [6] discover that successive layers in the same stage of residual networks are in fact estimating the same optimal feature map so that the outputs of these layers stay relatively close to each other at convergence. From this view, the proposed method actually forces each layer in the same stage of residual networks to independently estimate the optimal feature map, so as to learn better feature representation in each stage. A more proper comprehension of the proposed method is to train better single blocks instead of training redundant blocks. \n(3) In fact, what the authors attempt to emphasize in the analysis is that the proposed method not only can improve the performance but also the robustness in resisting various network destruction operations. In the practical application, the authors believe it’s important to ensure the running network won’t collapse due to some layers’ damage. \n(4) The key point of the proposed method is to provide each member (i.e., subnetworks) with appropriate supervision and make them has the consistent overall goal with the group (i.e., main network), instead of forcing each member to do the same job. \n(5) Table 1 in the main text show that the proposed method can maintain excellent performance and robustness on different models (e.g., MobileNet and ResNet) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-1K).\n[5] Greff K, Srivastava R K, Schmidhuber J.

The authors found that $\\beta = 0$ yielded slightly worse performance than $\\beta = 0.1$ and that increasing beta further provided no significant differences.

Setting $\\beta = 0.1$ also worked well across experiments.\n2. For $d$ in GCR, various values (on a log scale) were explored in each experiment. The authors found that the optimal value for $d$ can be different from task to task but setting $d = 10^{-3}$ worked reasonably well across tasks.
