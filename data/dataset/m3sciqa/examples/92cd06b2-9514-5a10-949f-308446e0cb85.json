            "reference_answer": "The performance of BERT on the NER task using a fine-tuning approach generally outperforms the feature-based approach, as the fine-tuning approach allows for minimal task-specific architecture modifications and leverages the deep bidirectional nature of BERT, which is crucial for understanding the context of entities in text. Different masking strategies during pre-training, such as random masking or keeping the word unchanged, are used to mitigate the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning stages, but the paper does not provide a direct comparison of these strategies' impact on the NER task specifically."
