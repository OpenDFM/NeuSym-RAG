            "reference_answer": "MetaBLINK uses a two-stage architecture for generating high-quality synthetic data for few-shot entity linking. Initially, it employs a heuristic method to generate mention-entity pairs. Then, it adopts a weak supervision strategy based on these mention-entity pairs to generate synthetic data. This process leverages a natural language generation model (NLG), specifically the T5 model, to rewrite mentions for generating more effective synthetic samples in the target domain. Additionally, MetaBLINK incorporates a meta-learning mechanism to automatically assign different weights to each synthetic data instance, improving the quality of the synthetic data used for model training."
