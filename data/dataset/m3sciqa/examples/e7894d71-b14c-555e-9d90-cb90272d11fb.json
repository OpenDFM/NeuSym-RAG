            "reference_answer": "The primary reason for the performance variance in EARL's ablation studies across different datasets is the different characteristics of the datasets, particularly the number of relations. Datasets with more relations (e.g., FB15k-237 and CoDEx-L) provide enough distinguishable information for entity embeddings through connected relation information (ConRel), making the performance less affected by the removal of other components like reserved entities or $k$NResEnt. In contrast, datasets with fewer relations (e.g., WN18RR and YAGO3-10) rely more on the distinguishable information provided by reserved entities and $k$NResEnt, showing more significant performance variance in the ablation studies."
