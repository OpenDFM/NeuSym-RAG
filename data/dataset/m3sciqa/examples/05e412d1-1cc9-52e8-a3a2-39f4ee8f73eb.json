            "reference_answer": "The sequential training approach of UniEval specifically addresses the negative transfer problem observed in certain evaluation dimensions by employing a method from continual learning: whenever a new dimension is introduced, a small portion of data from all previous dimensions is added to replay. This strategy allows for easy extension of the evaluator to new dimensions without training from scratch and enables explicit learning of dimensions related to basic linguistic features before moving on to dimensions that require a better understanding of the text."
