            "reference_answer": "The generation-based model employs a methodological approach that includes an extra knowledge selection paradigm enhanced by a knowledge-aware generator. This generator uses a combination of a prior distribution and a posterior distribution to mimic human knowledge selection. The prior distribution is based on the dialogue context and the dialogue goal, while the posterior distribution also considers the response. The model minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these two distributions to mimic human knowledge selection."
