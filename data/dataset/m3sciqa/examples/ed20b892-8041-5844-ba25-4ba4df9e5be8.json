            "reference_answer": "MMA-IL calculates the expected attention for each head using a softmax energy function and then applies the Monotonic Infinite Lookback Attention (MILk) formula to calculate the expected attention. This approach allows each attention head in MMA-IL to attend to all previous encoder states, leveraging more information for translation. In contrast, MMA-H calculates the expected alignment for each head using a hard selection process based on a Bernoulli distribution, where each head hard-attends to one encoder state, which may be better suited for streaming systems with stricter efficiency requirements."
