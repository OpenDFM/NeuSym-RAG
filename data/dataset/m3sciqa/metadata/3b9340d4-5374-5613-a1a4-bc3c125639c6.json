    "abstract": "The 8 bits quantization has been widely applied to accelerate network\ninference in various deep learning applications. There are two kinds of\nquantization methods, training-based quantization and post-training\nquantization. Training-based approach suffers from a cumbersome training\nprocess, while post-training quantization may lead to unacceptable accuracy\ndrop. In this paper, we present an efficient and simple post-training method\nvia scale optimization, named EasyQuant (EQ),that could obtain comparable\naccuracy with the training-based method.Specifically, we first alternately\noptimize scales of weights and activations for all layers target at\nconvolutional outputs to further obtain the high quantization precision. Then,\nwe lower down bit width to INT7 both for weights and activations, and adopt\nINT16 intermediate storage and integer Winograd convolution implementation to\naccelerate inference.Experimental results on various computer vision tasks show\nthat EQ outperforms the TensorRT method and can achieve near INT8 accuracy in 7\nbits width post-training.",
