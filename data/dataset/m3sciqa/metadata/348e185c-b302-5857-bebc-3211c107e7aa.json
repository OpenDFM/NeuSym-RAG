    "abstract": "We introduce deep inside-outside recursive autoencoders (DIORA), a\nfully-unsupervised method for discovering syntax that simultaneously learns\nrepresentations for constituents within the induced tree. Our approach predicts\neach word in an input sentence conditioned on the rest of the sentence and uses\ninside-outside dynamic programming to consider all possible binary trees over\nthe sentence. At test time the CKY algorithm extracts the highest scoring\nparse. DIORA achieves a new state-of-the-art F1 in unsupervised binary\nconstituency parsing (unlabeled) in two benchmark datasets, WSJ and MultiNLI.",
