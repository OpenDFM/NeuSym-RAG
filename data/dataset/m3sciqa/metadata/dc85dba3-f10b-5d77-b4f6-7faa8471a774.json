    "abstract": "Social media communication has become a significant part of daily activity in\nmodern societies. For this reason, ensuring safety in social media platforms is\na necessity. Use of dangerous language such as physical threats in online\nenvironments is a somewhat rare, yet remains highly important. Although several\nworks have been performed on the related issue of detecting offensive and\nhateful language, dangerous speech has not previously been treated in any\nsignificant way. Motivated by these observations, we report our efforts to\nbuild a labeled dataset for dangerous speech. We also exploit our dataset to\ndevelop highly effective models to detect dangerous content. Our best model\nperforms at 59.60% macro F1, significantly outperforming a competitive\nbaseline.",
