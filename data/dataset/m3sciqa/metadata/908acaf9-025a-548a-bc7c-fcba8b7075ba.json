    "abstract": "We describe AraNet, a collection of deep learning Arabic social media\nprocessing tools. Namely, we exploit an extensive host of publicly available\nand novel social media datasets to train bidirectional encoders from\ntransformer models (BERT) to predict age, dialect, gender, emotion, irony, and\nsentiment. AraNet delivers state-of-the-art performance on a number of the\ncited tasks and competitively on others. In addition, AraNet has the advantage\nof being exclusively based on a deep learning framework and hence feature\nengineering free. To the best of our knowledge, AraNet is the first to performs\npredictions across such a wide range of tasks for Arabic NLP and thus meets a\ncritical needs. We publicly release AraNet to accelerate research and\nfacilitate comparisons across the different tasks.",
