    "abstract": "A Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is a sequence of KGs corresponding to\ndifferent timestamps. TKG reasoning aims to predict potential facts in the\nfuture given the historical KG sequences. One key of this task is to mine and\nunderstand evolutional patterns of facts from these sequences. The evolutional\npatterns are complex in two aspects, length-diversity and time-variability.\nExisting models for TKG reasoning focus on modeling fact sequences of a fixed\nlength, which cannot discover complex evolutional patterns that vary in length.\nFurthermore, these models are all trained offline, which cannot well adapt to\nthe changes of evolutional patterns from then on. Thus, we propose a new model,\ncalled Complex Evolutional Network (CEN), which uses a length-aware\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to handle evolutional patterns of different\nlengths via an easy-to-difficult curriculum learning strategy. Besides, we\npropose to learn the model under the online setting so that it can adapt to the\nchanges of evolutional patterns over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CEN obtains substantial performance improvement under both the traditional\noffline and the proposed online settings.",
