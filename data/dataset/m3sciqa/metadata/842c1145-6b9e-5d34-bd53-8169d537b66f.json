    "abstract": "This paper presents UMASS_BioNLP team participation in the MEDIQA-Chat 2023\nshared task for Task-A and Task-C. We focus especially on Task-C and propose a\nnovel LLMs cooperation system named a doctor-patient loop to generate\nhigh-quality conversation data sets. The experiment results demonstrate that\nour approaches yield reasonable performance as evaluated by automatic metrics\nsuch as ROUGE, medical concept recall, BLEU, and Self-BLEU. Furthermore, we\nconducted a comparative analysis between our proposed method and ChatGPT and\nGPT-4. This analysis also investigates the potential of utilizing cooperation\nLLMs to generate high-quality datasets.",
