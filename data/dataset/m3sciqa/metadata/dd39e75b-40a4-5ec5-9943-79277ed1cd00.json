    "abstract": "Recent work on open domain question answering (QA) assumes strong supervision\nof the supporting evidence and/or assumes a blackbox information retrieval (IR)\nsystem to retrieve evidence candidates. We argue that both are suboptimal,\nsince gold evidence is not always available, and QA is fundamentally different\nfrom IR. We show for the first time that it is possible to jointly learn the\nretriever and reader from question-answer string pairs and without any IR\nsystem. In this setting, evidence retrieval from all of Wikipedia is treated as\na latent variable. Since this is impractical to learn from scratch, we\npre-train the retriever with an Inverse Cloze Task. We evaluate on open\nversions of five QA datasets. On datasets where the questioner already knows\nthe answer, a traditional IR system such as BM25 is sufficient. On datasets\nwhere a user is genuinely seeking an answer, we show that learned retrieval is\ncrucial, outperforming BM25 by up to 19 points in exact match.",
