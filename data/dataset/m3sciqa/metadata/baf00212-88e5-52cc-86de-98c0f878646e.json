    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various\nreasoning tasks. To further improve the performance, we propose MultiTool-CoT,\na novel framework that leverages chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to\nincorporate multiple external tools, such as a calculator and a knowledge\nretriever, during the reasoning process. We apply MultiTool-CoT to the Task 2\ndataset of NumGLUE, which requires both numerical reasoning and domain-specific\nknowledge. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms\nstrong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
