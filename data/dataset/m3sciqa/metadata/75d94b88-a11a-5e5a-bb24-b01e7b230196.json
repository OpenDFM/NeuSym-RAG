    "abstract": "Humans can reason compositionally when presented with new tasks. Previous\nresearch shows that appropriate prompting techniques enable large language\nmodels (LLMs) to solve artificial compositional generalization tasks such as\nSCAN. In this work, we identify additional challenges in more realistic\nsemantic parsing tasks with larger vocabulary and refine these prompting\ntechniques to address them. Our best method is based on least-to-most\nprompting: it decomposes the problem using prompting-based syntactic parsing,\nthen uses this decomposition to select appropriate exemplars and to\nsequentially generate the semantic parse. This method allows us to set a new\nstate of the art for CFQ while requiring only 1% of the training data used by\ntraditional approaches. Due to the general nature of our approach, we expect\nsimilar efforts will lead to new results in other tasks and domains, especially\nfor knowledge-intensive applications.",
