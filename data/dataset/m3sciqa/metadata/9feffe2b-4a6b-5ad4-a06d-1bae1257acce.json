    "abstract": "We present ASDiv (Academia Sinica Diverse MWP Dataset), a diverse (in terms\nof both language patterns and problem types) English math word problem (MWP)\ncorpus for evaluating the capability of various MWP solvers. Existing MWP\ncorpora for studying AI progress remain limited either in language usage\npatterns or in problem types. We thus present a new English MWP corpus with\n2,305 MWPs that cover more text patterns and most problem types taught in\nelementary school. Each MWP is annotated with its problem type and grade level\n(for indicating the level of difficulty). Furthermore, we propose a metric to\nmeasure the lexicon usage diversity of a given MWP corpus, and demonstrate that\nASDiv is more diverse than existing corpora. Experiments show that our proposed\ncorpus reflects the true capability of MWP solvers more faithfully.",
