    "abstract": "In this article, we tackle the math word problem, namely, automatically\nanswering a mathematical problem according to its textual description. Although\nrecent methods have demonstrated their promising results, most of these methods\nare based on template-based generation scheme which results in limited\ngeneralization capability. To this end, we propose a novel human-like\nanalogical learning method in a recall and learn manner. Our proposed framework\nis composed of modules of memory, representation, analogy, and reasoning, which\nare designed to make a new exercise by referring to the exercises learned in\nthe past. Specifically, given a math word problem, the model first retrieves\nsimilar questions by a memory module and then encodes the unsolved problem and\neach retrieved question using a representation module. Moreover, to solve the\nproblem in a way of analogy, an analogy module and a reasoning module with a\ncopy mechanism are proposed to model the interrelationship between the problem\nand each retrieved question. Extensive experiments on two well-known datasets\nshow the superiority of our proposed algorithm as compared to other\nstate-of-the-art competitors from both overall performance comparison and\nmicro-scope studies.",
