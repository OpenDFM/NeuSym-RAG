    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new framework for open-domain question answering in\nwhich the retriever and the reader iteratively interact with each other. The\nframework is agnostic to the architecture of the machine reading model, only\nrequiring access to the token-level hidden representations of the reader. The\nretriever uses fast nearest neighbor search to scale to corpora containing\nmillions of paragraphs. A gated recurrent unit updates the query at each step\nconditioned on the state of the reader and the reformulated query is used to\nre-rank the paragraphs by the retriever. We conduct analysis and show that\niterative interaction helps in retrieving informative paragraphs from the\ncorpus. Finally, we show that our multi-step-reasoning framework brings\nconsistent improvement when applied to two widely used reader architectures\nDrQA and BiDAF on various large open-domain datasets --- TriviaQA-unfiltered,\nQuasarT, SearchQA, and SQuAD-Open.",
