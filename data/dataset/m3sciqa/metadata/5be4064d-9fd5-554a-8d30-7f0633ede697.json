    "abstract": "Robots operating in human spaces must be able to engage in natural language\ninteraction with people, both understanding and executing instructions, and\nusing conversation to resolve ambiguity and recover from mistakes. To study\nthis, we introduce TEACh, a dataset of over 3,000 human--human, interactive\ndialogues to complete household tasks in simulation. A Commander with access to\noracle information about a task communicates in natural language with a\nFollower. The Follower navigates through and interacts with the environment to\ncomplete tasks varying in complexity from \"Make Coffee\" to \"Prepare Breakfast\",\nasking questions and getting additional information from the Commander. We\npropose three benchmarks using TEACh to study embodied intelligence challenges,\nand we evaluate initial models' abilities in dialogue understanding, language\ngrounding, and task execution.",
