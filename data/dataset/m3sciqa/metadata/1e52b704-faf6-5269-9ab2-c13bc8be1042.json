    "abstract": "Despite significant progress has been achieved in text summarization, factual\ninconsistency in generated summaries still severely limits its practical\napplications. Among the key factors to ensure factual consistency, a reliable\nautomatic evaluation metric is the first and the most crucial one. However,\nexisting metrics either neglect the intrinsic cause of the factual\ninconsistency or rely on auxiliary tasks, leading to an unsatisfied correlation\nwith human judgments or increasing the inconvenience of usage in practice. In\nlight of these challenges, we propose a novel metric to evaluate the factual\nconsistency in text summarization via counterfactual estimation, which\nformulates the causal relationship among the source document, the generated\nsummary, and the language prior. We remove the effect of language prior, which\ncan cause factual inconsistency, from the total causal effect on the generated\nsummary, and provides a simple yet effective way to evaluate consistency\nwithout relying on other auxiliary tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on\nthree public abstractive text summarization datasets, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed metric in both improving the correlation with human\njudgments and the convenience of usage.
