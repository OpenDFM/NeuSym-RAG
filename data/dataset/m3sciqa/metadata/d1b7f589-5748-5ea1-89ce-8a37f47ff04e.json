    "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine translation models are still not on par with human\ntranslators. Previous work takes human interactions into the neural machine\ntranslation process to obtain improved results in target languages. However,\nnot all model-translation errors are equal -- some are critical while others\nare minor. In the meanwhile, the same translation mistakes occur repeatedly in\na similar context. To solve both issues, we propose CAMIT, a novel method for\ntranslating in an interactive environment. Our proposed method works with\ncritical revision instructions, therefore allows human to correct arbitrary\nwords in model-translated sentences. In addition, CAMIT learns from and softly\nmemorizes revision actions based on the context, alleviating the issue of\nrepeating mistakes. Experiments in both ideal and real interactive translation\nsettings demonstrate that our proposed \\method enhances machine translation\nresults significantly while requires fewer revision instructions from human\ncompared to previous methods.",
