    "abstract": "Deep learning has led to significant improvement in text summarization with\nvarious methods investigated and improved ROUGE scores reported over the years.\nHowever, gaps still exist between summaries produced by automatic summarizers\nand human professionals. Aiming to gain more understanding of summarization\nsystems with respect to their strengths and limits on a fine-grained syntactic\nand semantic level, we consult the Multidimensional Quality Metric(MQM) and\nquantify 8 major sources of errors on 10 representative summarization models\nmanually. Primarily, we find that 1) under similar settings, extractive\nsummarizers are in general better than their abstractive counterparts thanks to\nstrength in faithfulness and factual-consistency; 2) milestone techniques such\nas copy, coverage and hybrid extractive/abstractive methods do bring specific\nimprovements but also demonstrate limitations; 3) pre-training techniques, and\nin particular sequence-to-sequence pre-training, are highly effective for\nimproving text summarization, with BART giving the best results.",
