    "abstract": "Named-entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying entities of interest in a\ntext. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have recently been shown to outperform\nexisting NER systems. However, ANNs remain challenging to use for non-expert\nusers. In this paper, we present NeuroNER, an easy-to-use named-entity\nrecognition tool based on ANNs. Users can annotate entities using a graphical\nweb-based user interface (BRAT): the annotations are then used to train an ANN,\nwhich in turn predict entities' locations and categories in new texts. NeuroNER\nmakes this annotation-training-prediction flow smooth and accessible to anyone.",
