    "abstract": "Solving math word problems is the task that analyses the relation of\nquantities and requires an accurate understanding of contextual natural\nlanguage information. Recent studies show that current models rely on shallow\nheuristics to predict solutions and could be easily misled by small textual\nperturbations. To address this problem, we propose a Textual Enhanced\nContrastive Learning framework, which enforces the models to distinguish\nsemantically similar examples while holding different mathematical logic. We\nadopt a self-supervised manner strategy to enrich examples with subtle textual\nvariance by textual reordering or problem re-construction. We then retrieve the\nhardest to differentiate samples from both equation and textual perspectives\nand guide the model to learn their representations. Experimental results show\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art on both widely used benchmark\ndatasets and also exquisitely designed challenge datasets in English and\nChinese. \\footnote{Our code and data is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/yiyunya/Textual_CL_MWP}",
