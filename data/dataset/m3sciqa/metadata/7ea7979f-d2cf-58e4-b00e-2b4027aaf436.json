    "abstract": "Predicting drug-target interaction is key for drug discovery. Recent deep\nlearning-based methods show promising performance but two challenges remain:\n(i) how to explicitly model and learn local interactions between drugs and\ntargets for better prediction and interpretation; (ii) how to generalize\nprediction performance on novel drug-target pairs from different distribution.\nIn this work, we propose DrugBAN, a deep bilinear attention network (BAN)\nframework with domain adaptation to explicitly learn pair-wise local\ninteractions between drugs and targets, and adapt on out-of-distribution data.\nDrugBAN works on drug molecular graphs and target protein sequences to perform\nprediction, with conditional domain adversarial learning to align learned\ninteraction representations across different distributions for better\ngeneralization on novel drug-target pairs. Experiments on three benchmark\ndatasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings show that DrugBAN\nachieves the best overall performance against five state-of-the-art baselines.\nMoreover, visualizing the learned bilinear attention map provides interpretable\ninsights from prediction results.",
