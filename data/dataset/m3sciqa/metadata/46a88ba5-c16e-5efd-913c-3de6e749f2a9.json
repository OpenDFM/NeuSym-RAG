    "abstract": "We present Spider, a large-scale, complex and cross-domain semantic parsing\nand text-to-SQL dataset annotated by 11 college students. It consists of 10,181\nquestions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 200 databases with multiple\ntables, covering 138 different domains. We define a new complex and\ncross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task where different complex SQL\nqueries and databases appear in train and test sets. In this way, the task\nrequires the model to generalize well to both new SQL queries and new database\nschemas. Spider is distinct from most of the previous semantic parsing tasks\nbecause they all use a single database and the exact same programs in the train\nset and the test set. We experiment with various state-of-the-art models and\nthe best model achieves only 12.4% exact matching accuracy on a database split\nsetting. This shows that Spider presents a strong challenge for future\nresearch. Our dataset and task are publicly available at\nhttps://yale-lily.github.io/spider",
