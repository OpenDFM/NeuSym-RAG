    "abstract": "Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) focuses on applying the technology of\nartificial intelligence, especially natural language processing, to benefit\ntasks in the legal domain. In recent years, LegalAI has drawn increasing\nattention rapidly from both AI researchers and legal professionals, as LegalAI\nis beneficial to the legal system for liberating legal professionals from a\nmaze of paperwork. Legal professionals often think about how to solve tasks\nfrom rule-based and symbol-based methods, while NLP researchers concentrate\nmore on data-driven and embedding methods. In this paper, we introduce the\nhistory, the current state, and the future directions of research in LegalAI.\nWe illustrate the tasks from the perspectives of legal professionals and NLP\nresearchers and show several representative applications in LegalAI. We conduct\nexperiments and provide an in-depth analysis of the advantages and\ndisadvantages of existing works to explore possible future directions.
