    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in text generation models, a serious limitation\nis their tendency to produce text that is factually inconsistent with\ninformation in the input. Recent work has studied whether textual entailment\nsystems can be used to identify factual errors; however, these sentence-level\nentailment models are trained to solve a different problem than generation\nfiltering and they do not localize which part of a generation is non-factual.\nIn this paper, we propose a new formulation of entailment that decomposes it at\nthe level of dependency arcs. Rather than focusing on aggregate decisions, we\ninstead ask whether the semantic relationship manifested by individual\ndependency arcs in the generated output is supported by the input. Human\njudgments on this task are difficult to obtain; we therefore propose a method\nto automatically create data based on existing entailment or paraphrase\ncorpora. Experiments show that our dependency arc entailment model trained on\nthis data can identify factual inconsistencies in paraphrasing and\nsummarization better than sentence-level methods or those based on question\ngeneration, while additionally localizing the erroneous parts of the\ngeneration.",
