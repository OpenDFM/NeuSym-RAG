    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI)\ncorpus, a dataset designed for use in the development and evaluation of machine\nlearning models for sentence understanding. In addition to being one of the\nlargest corpora available for the task of NLI, at 433k examples, this corpus\nimproves upon available resources in its coverage: it offers data from ten\ndistinct genres of written and spoken English--making it possible to evaluate\nsystems on nearly the full complexity of the language--and it offers an\nexplicit setting for the evaluation of cross-genre domain adaptation.",
