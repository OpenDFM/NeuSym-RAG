    "abstract": "Research on human spoken language has shown that speech plays an important\nrole in identifying speaker personality traits. In this work, we propose an\napproach for identifying speaker personality traits using overlap dynamics in\nmultiparty spoken dialogues. We first define a set of novel features\nrepresenting the overlap dynamics of each speaker. We then investigate the\nimpact of speaker personality traits on these features using ANOVA tests. We\nfind that features of overlap dynamics significantly vary for speakers with\ndifferent levels of both Extraversion and Conscientiousness. Finally, we find\nthat classifiers using only overlap dynamics features outperform random\nguessing in identifying Extraversion and Agreeableness, and that the\nimprovements are statistically significant.",
