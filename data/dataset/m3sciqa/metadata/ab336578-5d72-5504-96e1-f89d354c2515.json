    "abstract": "In recent years, Vietnam witnesses the mass development of social network\nusers on different social platforms such as Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and\nTiktok. On social medias, hate speech has become a critical problem for social\nnetwork users. To solve this problem, we introduce the ViHSD - a\nhuman-annotated dataset for automatically detecting hate speech on the social\nnetwork. This dataset contains over 30,000 comments, each comment in the\ndataset has one of three labels: CLEAN, OFFENSIVE, or HATE. Besides, we\nintroduce the data creation process for annotating and evaluating the quality\nof the dataset. Finally, we evaluated the dataset by deep learning models and\ntransformer models.",
