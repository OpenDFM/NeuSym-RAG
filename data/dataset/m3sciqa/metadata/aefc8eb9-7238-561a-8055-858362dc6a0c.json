    "abstract": "We present proppy, the first publicly available real-world, real-time\npropaganda detection system for online news, which aims at raising awareness,\nthus potentially limiting the impact of propaganda and helping fight\ndisinformation. The system constantly monitors a number of news sources,\ndeduplicates and clusters the news into events, and organizes the articles\nabout an event on the basis of the likelihood that they contain propagandistic\ncontent. The system is trained on known propaganda sources using a variety of\nstylistic features. The evaluation results on a standard dataset show\nstate-of-the-art results for propaganda detection.",
