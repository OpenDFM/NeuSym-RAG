    "abstract": "Online users today are exposed to misleading and propagandistic news articles\nand media posts on a daily basis. To counter thus, a number of approaches have\nbeen designed aiming to achieve a healthier and safer online news and media\nconsumption. Automatic systems are able to support humans in detecting such\ncontent; yet, a major impediment to their broad adoption is that besides being\naccurate, the decisions of such systems need also to be interpretable in order\nto be trusted and widely adopted by users. Since misleading and propagandistic\ncontent influences readers through the use of a number of deception techniques,\nwe propose to detect and to show the use of such techniques as a way to offer\ninterpretability. In particular, we define qualitatively descriptive features\nand we analyze their suitability for detecting deception techniques. We further\nshow that our interpretable features can be easily combined with pre-trained\nlanguage models, yielding state-of-the-art results.",
