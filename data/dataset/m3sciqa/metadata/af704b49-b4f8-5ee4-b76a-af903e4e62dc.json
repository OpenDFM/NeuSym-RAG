    "abstract": "Proactive dialogue systems, related to a wide range of real-world\nconversational applications, equip the conversational agent with the capability\nof leading the conversation direction towards achieving pre-defined targets or\nfulfilling certain goals from the system side. It is empowered by advanced\ntechniques to progress to more complicated tasks that require strategical and\nmotivational interactions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview\nof the prominent problems and advanced designs for conversational agent's\nproactivity in different types of dialogues. Furthermore, we discuss challenges\nthat meet the real-world application needs but require a greater research focus\nin the future. We hope that this first survey of proactive dialogue systems can\nprovide the community with a quick access and an overall picture to this\npractical problem, and stimulate more progresses on conversational AI to the\nnext level.",
