    "abstract": "Despite diverse efforts to mine various modalities of medical data, the\nconversations between physicians and patients at the time of care remain an\nuntapped source of insights. In this paper, we leverage this data to extract\nstructured information that might assist physicians with post-visit\ndocumentation in electronic health records, potentially lightening the clerical\nburden. In this exploratory study, we describe a new dataset consisting of\nconversation transcripts, post-visit summaries, corresponding supporting\nevidence (in the transcript), and structured labels. We focus on the tasks of\nrecognizing relevant diagnoses and abnormalities in the review of organ systems\n(RoS). One methodological challenge is that the conversations are long (around\n1500 words), making it difficult for modern deep-learning models to use them as\ninput. To address this challenge, we extract noteworthy utterances---parts of\nthe conversation likely to be cited as evidence supporting some summary\nsentence. We find that by first filtering for (predicted) noteworthy\nutterances, we can significantly boost predictive performance for recognizing\nboth diagnoses and RoS abnormalities.",
