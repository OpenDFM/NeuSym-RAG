    "abstract": "The field of machine learning has taken a dramatic twist in recent times,\nwith the rise of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). These biologically\ninspired computational models are able to far exceed the performance of\nprevious forms of artificial intelligence in common machine learning tasks. One\nof the most impressive forms of ANN architecture is that of the Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). CNNs are primarily used to solve difficult image-driven\npattern recognition tasks and with their precise yet simple architecture,\noffers a simplified method of getting started with ANNs.\n  This document provides a brief introduction to CNNs, discussing recently\npublished papers and newly formed techniques in developing these brilliantly\nfantastic image recognition models. This introduction assumes you are familiar\nwith the fundamentals of ANNs and machine learning.",
