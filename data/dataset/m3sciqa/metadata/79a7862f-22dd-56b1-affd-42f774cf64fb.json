    "abstract": "Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence have produced agents that can beat\nhuman world champions at games like Go, Starcraft, and Dota2. However, most of\nthese models do not seem to play in a human-like manner: People infer others'\nintentions from their behaviour, and use these inferences in scheming and\nstrategizing. Here, using a Bayesian Theory of Mind (ToM) approach, we\ninvestigated how much an explicit representation of others' intentions improves\nperformance in a cooperative game. We compared the performance of humans\nplaying with optimal-planning agents with and without ToM, in a cooperative\ngame where players have to flexibly cooperate to achieve joint goals. We find\nthat teams with ToM agents significantly outperform non-ToM agents when\ncollaborating with all types of partners: non-ToM, ToM, as well as human\nplayers, and that the benefit of ToM increases the more ToM agents there are.\nThese findings have implications for designing better cooperative agents.",
