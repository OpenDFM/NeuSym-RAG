    "abstract": "Current research on hate speech analysis is typically oriented towards\nmonolingual and single classification tasks. In this paper, we present a new\nmultilingual multi-aspect hate speech analysis dataset and use it to test the\ncurrent state-of-the-art multilingual multitask learning approaches. We\nevaluate our dataset in various classification settings, then we discuss how to\nleverage our annotations in order to improve hate speech detection and\nclassification in general.",
