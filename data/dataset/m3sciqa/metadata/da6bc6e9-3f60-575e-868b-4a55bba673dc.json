    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRS) aim to recommend high-quality items\nto users through interactive conversations. To develop an effective CRS, the\nsupport of high-quality datasets is essential. Existing CRS datasets mainly\nfocus on immediate requests from users, while lack proactive guidance to the\nrecommendation scenario. In this paper, we contribute a new CRS dataset named\n\\textbf{TG-ReDial} (\\textbf{Re}commendation through\n\\textbf{T}opic-\\textbf{G}uided \\textbf{Dial}og). Our dataset has two major\nfeatures. First, it incorporates topic threads to enforce natural semantic\ntransitions towards the recommendation scenario. Second, it is created in a\nsemi-automatic way, hence human annotation is more reasonable and controllable.\nBased on TG-ReDial, we present the task of topic-guided conversational\nrecommendation, and propose an effective approach to this task. Extensive\nexperiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on three\nsub-tasks, namely topic prediction, item recommendation and response\ngeneration. TG-ReDial is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/TG-ReDial.",
