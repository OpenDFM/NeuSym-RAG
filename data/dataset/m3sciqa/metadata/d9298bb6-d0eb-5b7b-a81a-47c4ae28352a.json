    "abstract": "Previous works on key information extraction from visually rich documents\n(VRDs) mainly focus on labeling the text within each bounding box (i.e.,\nsemantic entity), while the relations in-between are largely unexplored. In\nthis paper, we adapt the popular dependency parsing model, the biaffine parser,\nto this entity relation extraction task. Being different from the original\ndependency parsing model which recognizes dependency relations between words,\nwe identify relations between groups of words with layout information instead.\nWe have compared different representations of the semantic entity, different\nVRD encoders, and different relation decoders. The results demonstrate that our\nproposed model achieves 65.96% F1 score on the FUNSD dataset. As for the\nreal-world application, our model has been applied to the in-house customs\ndata, achieving reliable performance in the production setting.",
