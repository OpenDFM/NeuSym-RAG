    "abstract": "Compositional generalization is a basic and essential intellective capability\nof human beings, which allows us to recombine known parts readily. However,\nexisting neural network based models have been proven to be extremely deficient\nin such a capability. Inspired by work in cognition which argues\ncompositionality can be captured by variable slots with symbolic functions, we\npresent a refreshing view that connects a memory-augmented neural model with\nanalytical expressions, to achieve compositional generalization. Our model\nconsists of two cooperative neural modules, Composer and Solver, fitting well\nwith the cognitive argument while being able to be trained in an end-to-end\nmanner via a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm. Experiments on the\nwell-known benchmark SCAN demonstrate that our model seizes a great ability of\ncompositional generalization, solving all challenges addressed by previous\nworks with 100% accuracies.",
