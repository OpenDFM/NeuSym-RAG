    "abstract": "Math word problem solver requires both precise relation reasoning about\nquantities in the text and reliable generation for the diverse equation.\nCurrent sequence-to-tree or relation extraction methods regard this only from a\nfixed view, struggling to simultaneously handle complex semantics and diverse\nequations. However, human solving naturally involves two consistent reasoning\nviews: top-down and bottom-up, just as math equations also can be expressed in\nmultiple equivalent forms: pre-order and post-order. We propose a multi-view\nconsistent contrastive learning for a more complete semantics-to-equation\nmapping. The entire process is decoupled into two independent but consistent\nviews: top-down decomposition and bottom-up construction, and the two reasoning\nviews are aligned in multi-granularity for consistency, enhancing global\ngeneration and precise reasoning. Experiments on multiple datasets across two\nlanguages show our approach significantly outperforms the existing baselines,\nespecially on complex problems. We also show after consistent alignment,\nmulti-view can absorb the merits of both views and generate more diverse\nresults consistent with the mathematical laws.",
