    "abstract": "We introduce Mintaka, a complex, natural, and multilingual dataset designed\nfor experimenting with end-to-end question-answering models. Mintaka is\ncomposed of 20,000 question-answer pairs collected in English, annotated with\nWikidata entities, and translated into Arabic, French, German, Hindi, Italian,\nJapanese, Portuguese, and Spanish for a total of 180,000 samples. Mintaka\nincludes 8 types of complex questions, including superlative, intersection, and\nmulti-hop questions, which were naturally elicited from crowd workers. We run\nbaselines over Mintaka, the best of which achieves 38% hits@1 in English and\n31% hits@1 multilingually, showing that existing models have room for\nimprovement. We release Mintaka at https://github.com/amazon-research/mintaka.",
