    "abstract": "Due to the absence of connectives, implicit discourse relation recognition\n(IDRR) is still a challenging and crucial task in discourse analysis. Most of\nthe current work adopted multi-task learning to aid IDRR through explicit\ndiscourse relation recognition (EDRR) or utilized dependencies between\ndiscourse relation labels to constrain model predictions. But these methods\nstill performed poorly on fine-grained IDRR and even utterly misidentified on\nmost of the few-shot discourse relation classes. To address these problems, we\npropose a novel Prompt-based Connective Prediction (PCP) method for IDRR. Our\nmethod instructs large-scale pre-trained models to use knowledge relevant to\ndiscourse relation and utilizes the strong correlation between connectives and\ndiscourse relation to help the model recognize implicit discourse relations.\nExperimental results show that our method surpasses the current\nstate-of-the-art model and achieves significant improvements on those\nfine-grained few-shot discourse relation. Moreover, our approach is able to be\ntransferred to EDRR and obtain acceptable results. Our code is released in\nhttps://github.com/zh-i9/PCP-for-IDRR.",
