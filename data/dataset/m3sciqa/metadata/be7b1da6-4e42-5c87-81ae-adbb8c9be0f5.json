    "abstract": "Many classification models work poorly on short texts due to data sparsity.\nTo address this issue, we propose topic memory networks for short text\nclassification with a novel topic memory mechanism to encode latent topic\nrepresentations indicative of class labels. Different from most prior work that\nfocuses on extending features with external knowledge or pre-trained topics,\nour model jointly explores topic inference and text classification with memory\nnetworks in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on four benchmark\ndatasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on short text\nclassification, meanwhile generates coherent topics.",
