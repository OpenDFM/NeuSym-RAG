    "abstract": "Knowledge-grounded dialog systems need to incorporate smooth transitions\namong knowledge selected for generating responses, to ensure that dialog flows\nnaturally. For document-grounded dialog systems, the inter- and intra-document\nknowledge relations can be used to model such conversational flows. We develop\na novel Multi-Document Co-Referential Graph (Coref-MDG) to effectively capture\nthe inter-document relationships based on commonsense and similarity and the\nintra-document co-referential structures of knowledge segments within the\ngrounding documents. We propose CorefDiffs, a Co-referential and Differential\nflow management method, to linearize the static Coref-MDG into conversational\nsequence logic. CorefDiffs performs knowledge selection by accounting for\ncontextual graph structures and the knowledge difference sequences. CorefDiffs\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 9.5\\%, 7.4\\%, and 8.2\\% on\nthree public benchmarks. This demonstrates that the effective modeling of\nco-reference and knowledge difference for dialog flows are critical for\ntransitions in document-grounded conversation",
