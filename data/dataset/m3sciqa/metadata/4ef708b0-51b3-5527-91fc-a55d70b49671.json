    "abstract": "Effective molecular representation learning is of great importance to\nfacilitate molecular property prediction, which is a fundamental task for the\ndrug and material industry. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs)\nhave shown great promise in applying GNNs for molecular representation\nlearning. Moreover, a few recent studies have also demonstrated successful\napplications of self-supervised learning methods to pre-train the GNNs to\novercome the problem of insufficient labeled molecules. However, existing GNNs\nand pre-training strategies usually treat molecules as topological graph data\nwithout fully utilizing the molecular geometry information. Whereas, the\nthree-dimensional (3D) spatial structure of a molecule, a.k.a molecular\ngeometry, is one of the most critical factors for determining molecular\nphysical, chemical, and biological properties. To this end, we propose a novel\nGeometry Enhanced Molecular representation learning method (GEM) for Chemical\nRepresentation Learning (ChemRL). At first, we design a geometry-based GNN\narchitecture that simultaneously models atoms, bonds, and bond angles in a\nmolecule. To be specific, we devised double graphs for a molecule: The first\none encodes the atom-bond relations; The second one encodes bond-angle\nrelations. Moreover, on top of the devised GNN architecture, we propose several\nnovel geometry-level self-supervised learning strategies to learn spatial\nknowledge by utilizing the local and global molecular 3D structures. We compare\nChemRL-GEM with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines on different\nmolecular benchmarks and exhibit that ChemRL-GEM can significantly outperform\nall baselines in both regression and classification tasks. For example, the\nexperimental results show an overall improvement of 8.8% on average compared to\nSOTA baselines on the regression tasks, demonstrating the superiority of the\nproposed method.",
