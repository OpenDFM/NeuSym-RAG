    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) frequently suffers from the problem of\ninsufficient labeled data, particularly in fine-grained NER scenarios. Although\n$K$-shot learning techniques can be applied, their performance tends to\nsaturate when the number of annotations exceeds several tens of labels. To\novercome this problem, we utilize existing coarse-grained datasets that offer a\nlarge number of annotations. A straightforward approach to address this problem\nis pre-finetuning, which employs coarse-grained data for representation\nlearning. However, it cannot directly utilize the relationships between\nfine-grained and coarse-grained entities, although a fine-grained entity type\nis likely to be a subcategory of a coarse-grained entity type. We propose a\nfine-grained NER model with a Fine-to-Coarse(F2C) mapping matrix to leverage\nthe hierarchical structure explicitly. In addition, we present an inconsistency\nfiltering method to eliminate coarse-grained entities that are inconsistent\nwith fine-grained entity types to avoid performance degradation. Our\nexperimental results show that our method outperforms both $K$-shot learning\nand supervised learning methods when dealing with a small number of\nfine-grained annotations.",
