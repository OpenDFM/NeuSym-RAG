    "abstract": "Automatic generation of summaries from multiple news articles is a valuable\ntool as the number of online publications grows rapidly. Single document\nsummarization (SDS) systems have benefited from advances in neural\nencoder-decoder model thanks to the availability of large datasets. However,\nmulti-document summarization (MDS) of news articles has been limited to\ndatasets of a couple of hundred examples. In this paper, we introduce\nMulti-News, the first large-scale MDS news dataset. Additionally, we propose an\nend-to-end model which incorporates a traditional extractive summarization\nmodel with a standard SDS model and achieves competitive results on MDS\ndatasets. We benchmark several methods on Multi-News and release our data and\ncode in hope that this work will promote advances in summarization in the\nmulti-document setting.",
