    "abstract": "Currently, in the study of multiagent systems, the intentions of agents are\nusually ignored. Nonetheless, as pointed out by Theory of Mind (ToM), people\nregularly reason about other's mental states, including beliefs, goals, and\nintentions, to obtain performance advantage in competition, cooperation or\ncoalition. However, due to its intrinsic recursion and intractable modeling of\ndistribution over belief, integrating ToM in multiagent planning and decision\nmaking is still a challenge. In this paper, we incorporate ToM in multiagent\npartially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose an adaptive\ntraining algorithm to develop effective collaboration between agents with ToM.\nWe evaluate our algorithms with two games, where our algorithm surpasses all\nprevious decentralized execution algorithms without modeling ToM.",
