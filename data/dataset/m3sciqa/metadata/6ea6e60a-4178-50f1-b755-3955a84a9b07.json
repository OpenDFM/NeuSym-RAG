    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a widely studied task in natural language\nprocessing. Recently, a growing number of studies have focused on the nested\nNER. The span-based methods, considering the entity recognition as a span\nclassification task, can deal with nested entities naturally. But they suffer\nfrom the huge search space and the lack of interactions between entities. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel sequence-to-set neural network for\nnested NER. Instead of specifying candidate spans in advance, we provide a\nfixed set of learnable vectors to learn the patterns of the valuable spans. We\nutilize a non-autoregressive decoder to predict the final set of entities in\none pass, in which we are able to capture dependencies between entities.\nCompared with the sequence-to-sequence method, our model is more suitable for\nsuch unordered recognition task as it is insensitive to the label order. In\naddition, we utilize the loss function based on bipartite matching to compute\nthe overall training loss. Experimental results show that our proposed model\nachieves state-of-the-art on three nested NER corpora: ACE 2004, ACE 2005 and\nKBP 2017. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/zqtan1024/sequence-to-set.",
