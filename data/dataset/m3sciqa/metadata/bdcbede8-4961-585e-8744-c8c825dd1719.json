    "abstract": "Distant supervision tackles the data bottleneck in NER by automatically\ngenerating training instances via dictionary matching. Unfortunately, the\nlearning of DS-NER is severely dictionary-biased, which suffers from spurious\ncorrelations and therefore undermines the effectiveness and the robustness of\nthe learned models. In this paper, we fundamentally explain the dictionary bias\nvia a Structural Causal Model (SCM), categorize the bias into intra-dictionary\nand inter-dictionary biases, and identify their causes. Based on the SCM, we\nlearn de-biased DS-NER via causal interventions. For intra-dictionary bias, we\nconduct backdoor adjustment to remove the spurious correlations introduced by\nthe dictionary confounder. For inter-dictionary bias, we propose a causal\ninvariance regularizer which will make DS-NER models more robust to the\nperturbation of dictionaries. Experiments on four datasets and three DS-NER\nmodels show that our method can significantly improve the performance of\nDS-NER.",
