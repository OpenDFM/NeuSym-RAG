    "abstract": "A rich amount of geographic information exists in unstructured texts, such as\nWeb pages, social media posts, housing advertisements, and historical archives.\nGeoparsers are useful tools that extract structured geographic information from\nunstructured texts, thereby enabling spatial analysis on textual data. While a\nnumber of geoparsers were developed, they were tested on different datasets\nusing different metrics. Consequently, it is difficult to compare existing\ngeoparsers or to compare a new geoparser with existing ones. In recent years,\nresearchers created open and annotated corpora for testing geoparsers. While\nthese corpora are extremely valuable, much effort is still needed for a\nresearcher to prepare these datasets and deploy geoparsers for comparative\nexperiments. This paper presents EUPEG: an Extensible and Unified Platform for\nEvaluating Geoparsers. EUPEG is an open source and Web based benchmarking\nplatform which hosts a majority of open corpora, geoparsers, and performance\nmetrics reported in the literature. It enables direct comparison of the hosted\ngeoparsers, and a new geoparser can be connected to EUPEG and compared with\nother geoparsers. The main objective of EUPEG is to reduce the time and effort\nthat researchers have to spend in preparing datasets and baselines, thereby\nincreasing the efficiency and effectiveness of comparative experiments.",
