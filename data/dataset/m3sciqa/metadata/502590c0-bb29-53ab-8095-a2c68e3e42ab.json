    "abstract": "Breaking down the structure of long texts into semantically coherent segments\nmakes the texts more readable and supports downstream applications like\nsummarization and retrieval. Starting from an apparent link between text\ncoherence and segmentation, we introduce a novel supervised model for text\nsegmentation with simple but explicit coherence modeling. Our model -- a neural\narchitecture consisting of two hierarchically connected Transformer networks --\nis a multi-task learning model that couples the sentence-level segmentation\nobjective with the coherence objective that differentiates correct sequences of\nsentences from corrupt ones. The proposed model, dubbed Coherence-Aware Text\nSegmentation (CATS), yields state-of-the-art segmentation performance on a\ncollection of benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by coupling CATS with\ncross-lingual word embeddings, we demonstrate its effectiveness in zero-shot\nlanguage transfer: it can successfully segment texts in languages unseen in\ntraining.",
