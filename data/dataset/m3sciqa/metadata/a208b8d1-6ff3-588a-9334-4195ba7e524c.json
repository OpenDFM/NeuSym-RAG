    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) entity typing aims at inferring possible missing entity\ntype instances in KG, which is a very significant but still under-explored\nsubtask of knowledge graph completion. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach for KG entity typing which is trained by jointly utilizing local\ntyping knowledge from existing entity type assertions and global triple\nknowledge from KGs. Specifically, we present two distinct knowledge-driven\neffective mechanisms of entity type inference. Accordingly, we build two novel\nembedding models to realize the mechanisms. Afterward, a joint model with them\nis used to infer missing entity type instances, which favors inferences that\nagree with both entity type instances and triple knowledge in KGs. Experimental\nresults on two real-world datasets (Freebase and YAGO) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed mechanisms and models for improving KG entity\ntyping.
