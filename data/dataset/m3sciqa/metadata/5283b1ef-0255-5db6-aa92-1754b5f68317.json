    "abstract": "One major obstacle towards AI is the poor ability of models to solve new\nproblems quicker, and without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. To\nbetter understand this issue, we study the problem of continual learning, where\nthe model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning a sequence of\ntasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a\ncontinuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test\naccuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across\ntasks. Second, we propose a model for continual learning, called Gradient\nEpisodic Memory (GEM) that alleviates forgetting, while allowing beneficial\ntransfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the\nMNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when\ncompared to the state-of-the-art.",
