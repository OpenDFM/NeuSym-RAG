    "abstract": "State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal\nalgorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN\nhave reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region\nproposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region\nProposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the\ndetection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a\nfully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and\nobjectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate\nhigh-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We\nfurther merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their\nconvolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural\nnetworks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified\nnetwork where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has\na frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving\nstate-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS\nCOCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015\ncompetitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning\nentries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.",
