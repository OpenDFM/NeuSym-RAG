    "abstract": "We present Meta Pseudo Labels, a semi-supervised learning method that\nachieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 90.2% on ImageNet, which is\n1.6% better than the existing state-of-the-art. Like Pseudo Labels, Meta Pseudo\nLabels has a teacher network to generate pseudo labels on unlabeled data to\nteach a student network. However, unlike Pseudo Labels where the teacher is\nfixed, the teacher in Meta Pseudo Labels is constantly adapted by the feedback\nof the student's performance on the labeled dataset. As a result, the teacher\ngenerates better pseudo labels to teach the student. Our code will be available\nat\nhttps://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/meta_pseudo_labels.",
