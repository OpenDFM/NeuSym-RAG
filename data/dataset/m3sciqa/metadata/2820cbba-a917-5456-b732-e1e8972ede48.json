    "abstract": "In open-domain dialogue intelligent agents should exhibit the use of\nknowledge, however there are few convincing demonstrations of this to date. The\nmost popular sequence to sequence models typically \"generate and hope\" generic\nutterances that can be memorized in the weights of the model when mapping from\ninput utterance(s) to output, rather than employing recalled knowledge as\ncontext. Use of knowledge has so far proved difficult, in part because of the\nlack of a supervised learning benchmark task which exhibits knowledgeable open\ndialogue with clear grounding. To that end we collect and release a large\ndataset with conversations directly grounded with knowledge retrieved from\nWikipedia. We then design architectures capable of retrieving knowledge,\nreading and conditioning on it, and finally generating natural responses. Our\nbest performing dialogue models are able to conduct knowledgeable discussions\non open-domain topics as evaluated by automatic metrics and human evaluations,\nwhile our new benchmark allows for measuring further improvements in this\nimportant research direction.",
