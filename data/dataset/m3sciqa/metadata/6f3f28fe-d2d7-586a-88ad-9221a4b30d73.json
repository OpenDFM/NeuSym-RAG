    "abstract": "We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage\nenough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving\nfull 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\n4-bit training.",
