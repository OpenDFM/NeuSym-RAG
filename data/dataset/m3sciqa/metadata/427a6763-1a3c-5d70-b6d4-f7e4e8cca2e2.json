    "abstract": "This paper introduces a document grounded dataset for text conversations. We\ndefine \"Document Grounded Conversations\" as conversations that are about the\ncontents of a specified document. In this dataset the specified documents were\nWikipedia articles about popular movies. The dataset contains 4112\nconversations with an average of 21.43 turns per conversation. This positions\nthis dataset to not only provide a relevant chat history while generating\nresponses but also provide a source of information that the models could use.\nWe describe two neural architectures that provide benchmark performance on the\ntask of generating the next response. We also evaluate our models for\nengagement and fluency, and find that the information from the document helps\nin generating more engaging and fluent responses.",
