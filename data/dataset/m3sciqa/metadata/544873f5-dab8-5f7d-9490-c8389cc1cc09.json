    "abstract": "We introduce REALTIME QA, a dynamic question answering (QA) platform that\nannounces questions and evaluates systems on a regular basis (weekly in this\nversion). REALTIME QA inquires about the current world, and QA systems need to\nanswer questions about novel events or information. It therefore challenges\nstatic, conventional assumptions in open-domain QA datasets and pursues\ninstantaneous applications. We build strong baseline models upon large\npretrained language models, including GPT-3 and T5. Our benchmark is an ongoing\neffort, and this paper presents real-time evaluation results over the past\nyear. Our experimental results show that GPT-3 can often properly update its\ngeneration results, based on newly-retrieved documents, highlighting the\nimportance of up-to-date information retrieval. Nonetheless, we find that GPT-3\ntends to return outdated answers when retrieved documents do not provide\nsufficient information to find an answer. This suggests an important avenue for\nfuture research: can an open-domain QA system identify such unanswerable cases\nand communicate with the user or even the retrieval module to modify the\nretrieval results? We hope that REALTIME QA will spur progress in instantaneous\napplications of question answering and beyond.",
