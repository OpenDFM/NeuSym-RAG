    "abstract": "Much recent progress in applications of machine learning models to NLP has\nbeen driven by benchmarks that evaluate models across a wide variety of tasks.\nHowever, these broad-coverage benchmarks have been mostly limited to English,\nand despite an increasing interest in multilingual models, a benchmark that\nenables the comprehensive evaluation of such methods on a diverse range of\nlanguages and tasks is still missing. To this end, we introduce the\nCross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders XTREME benchmark, a\nmulti-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization\ncapabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks.\nWe demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on\nmany tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually\ntransferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks.\nThere is also a wide spread of results across languages. We release the\nbenchmark to encourage research on cross-lingual learning methods that transfer\nlinguistic knowledge across a diverse and representative set of languages and\ntasks.",
