    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning models have made great progress in MWP solving on\nanswer accuracy. However, they are uninterpretable since they mainly rely on\nshallow heuristics to achieve high performance without understanding and\nreasoning the grounded math logic. To address this issue and make a step\ntowards interpretable MWP solving, we first construct a high-quality MWP\ndataset named InterMWP which consists of 11,495 MWPs and annotates\ninterpretable logical formulas based on algebraic knowledge as the grounded\nlinguistic logic of each solution equation. Different from existing MWP\ndatasets, our InterMWP benchmark asks for a solver to not only output the\nsolution expressions but also predict the corresponding logical formulas. We\nfurther propose a novel approach with logical prompt and interpretation\ngeneration, called LogicSolver. For each MWP, our LogicSolver first retrieves\nsome highly-correlated algebraic knowledge and then passes them to the backbone\nmodel as prompts to improve the semantic representations of MWPs. With these\nimproved semantic representations, our LogicSolver generates corresponding\nsolution expressions and interpretable knowledge formulas in accord with the\ngenerated solution expressions, simultaneously. Experimental results show that\nour LogicSolver has stronger logical formula-based interpretability than\nbaselines while achieving higher answer accuracy with the help of logical\nprompts, simultaneously. The source code and dataset is available at\nhttps://github.com/yangzhch6/InterMWP.",
