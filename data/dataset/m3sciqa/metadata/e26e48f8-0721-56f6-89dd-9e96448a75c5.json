    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Pre-training (VLP) has improved performance on various\njoint vision-and-language downstream tasks. Current approaches to VLP heavily\nrely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region\nsupervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g.,\nResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in\nterms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features\nrequires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2)\nexpressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual\nembedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a\nminimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the\nsense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just\nthe same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that\nViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with\ncompetitive or better downstream task performance.
