    "abstract": "Maximizing the user-item engagement based on vectorized embeddings is a\nstandard procedure of recent recommender models. Despite the superior\nperformance for item recommendations, these methods however implicitly\ndeprioritize the modeling of user-wise similarity in the embedding space;\nconsequently, identifying similar users is underperforming, and additional\nprocessing schemes are usually required otherwise. To avoid thorough model\nre-training, we propose WSFE, a model-agnostic and training-free representation\nencoder, to be flexibly employed on the fly for effective user segmentation.\nUnderpinned by the optimal transport theory, the encoded representations from\nWSFE present a matched user-wise similarity/distance measurement between the\nrealistic and embedding space. We incorporate WSFE into six state-of-the-art\nrecommender models and conduct extensive experiments on six real-world\ndatasets. The empirical analyses well demonstrate the superiority and\ngenerality of WSFE to fuel multiple downstream tasks with diverse underlying\ntargets in recommendation.",
