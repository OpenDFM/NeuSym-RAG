    "abstract": "Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug\ndiscovery. The high cost and labor-intensive nature of in vitro and in vivo\nexperiments have highlighted the importance of in silico-based DTI prediction\napproaches. In several computational models, conventional protein descriptors\nare shown to be not informative enough to predict accurate DTIs. Thus, in this\nstudy, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw protein sequences\nto capture local residue patterns participating in DTIs. With CNN on protein\nsequences, our model performs better than previous protein descriptor-based\nmodels. In addition, our model performs better than the previous deep learning\nmodel for massive prediction of DTIs. By examining the pooled convolution\nresults, we found that our model can detect binding sites of proteins for DTIs.\nIn conclusion, our prediction model for detecting local residue patterns of\ntarget proteins successfully enriches the protein features of a raw protein\nsequence, yielding better prediction results than previous approaches.",
