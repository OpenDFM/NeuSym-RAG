    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the application of text classification methods\nto support law professionals. We present several experiments applying machine\nlearning techniques to predict with high accuracy the ruling of the French\nSupreme Court and the law area to which a case belongs to. We also investigate\nthe influence of the time period in which a ruling was made on the form of the\ncase description and the extent to which we need to mask information in a full\ncase ruling to automatically obtain training and test data that resembles case\ndescriptions. We developed a mean probability ensemble system combining the\noutput of multiple SVM classifiers. We report results of 98% average F1 score\nin predicting a case ruling, 96% F1 score for predicting the law area of a\ncase, and 87.07% F1 score on estimating the date of a ruling.",
