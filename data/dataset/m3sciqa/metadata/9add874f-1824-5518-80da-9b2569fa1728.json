    "abstract": "We consider open-domain queston answering (QA) where answers are drawn from\neither a corpus, a knowledge base (KB), or a combination of both of these. We\nfocus on a setting in which a corpus is supplemented with a large but\nincomplete KB, and on questions that require non-trivial (e.g., ``multi-hop'')\nreasoning. We describe PullNet, an integrated framework for (1) learning what\nto retrieve (from the KB and/or corpus) and (2) reasoning with this\nheterogeneous information to find the best answer. PullNet uses an {iterative}\nprocess to construct a question-specific subgraph that contains information\nrelevant to the question. In each iteration, a graph convolutional network\n(graph CNN) is used to identify subgraph nodes that should be expanded using\nretrieval (or ``pull'') operations on the corpus and/or KB. After the subgraph\nis complete, a similar graph CNN is used to extract the answer from the\nsubgraph. This retrieve-and-reason process allows us to answer multi-hop\nquestions using large KBs and corpora. PullNet is weakly supervised, requiring\nquestion-answer pairs but not gold inference paths. Experimentally PullNet\nimproves over the prior state-of-the art, and in the setting where a corpus is\nused with incomplete KB these improvements are often dramatic. PullNet is also\noften superior to prior systems in a KB-only setting or a text-only setting.",
