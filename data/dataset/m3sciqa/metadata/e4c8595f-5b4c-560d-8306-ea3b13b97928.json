    "abstract": "In this paper, we summarize the current state of the field of NLP & Law with\na specific focus on recent technical and substantive developments. To support\nour analysis, we construct and analyze a nearly complete corpus of more than\nsix hundred NLP & Law related papers published over the past decade. Our\nanalysis highlights several major trends. Namely, we document an increasing\nnumber of papers written, tasks undertaken, and languages covered over the\ncourse of the past decade. We observe an increase in the sophistication of the\nmethods which researchers deployed in this applied context. Slowly but surely,\nLegal NLP is beginning to match not only the methodological sophistication of\ngeneral NLP but also the professional standards of data availability and code\nreproducibility observed within the broader scientific community. We believe\nall of these trends bode well for the future of the field, but many questions\nin both the academic and commercial sphere still remain open.",
