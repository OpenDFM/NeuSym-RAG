    "abstract": "Steering language generation towards objectives or away from undesired\ncontent has been a long-standing goal in utilizing language models (LM). Recent\nwork has demonstrated reinforcement learning and weighted decoding as effective\napproaches to achieve a higher level of language control and quality with pros\nand cons. In this work, we propose a novel critic decoding method for\ncontrolled language generation (CriticControl) that combines the strengths of\nreinforcement learning and weighted decoding. Specifically, we adopt the\nactor-critic framework to train an LM-steering critic from non-differentiable\nreward models. And similar to weighted decoding, our method freezes the\nlanguage model and manipulates the output token distribution using called\ncritic, improving training efficiency and stability. Evaluation of our method\non three controlled generation tasks, namely topic control, sentiment control,\nand detoxification, shows that our approach generates more coherent and\nwell-controlled texts than previous methods. In addition, CriticControl\ndemonstrates superior generalization ability in zero-shot settings. Human\nevaluation studies also corroborate our findings.",
