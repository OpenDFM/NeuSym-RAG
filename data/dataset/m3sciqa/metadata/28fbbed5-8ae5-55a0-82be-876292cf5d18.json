    "abstract": "Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic representation for natural\nlanguage that embeds annotations related to traditional tasks such as named\nentity recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation and\nco-reference resolution. We describe a transition-based parser for AMR that\nparses sentences left-to-right, in linear time. We further propose a test-suite\nthat assesses specific subtasks that are helpful in comparing AMR parsers, and\nshow that our parser is competitive with the state of the art on the LDC2015E86\ndataset and that it outperforms state-of-the-art parsers for recovering named\nentities and handling polarity.",
