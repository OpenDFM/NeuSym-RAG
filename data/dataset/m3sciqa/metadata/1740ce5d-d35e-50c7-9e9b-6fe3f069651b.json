    "abstract": "We explore story generation: creative systems that can build coherent and\nfluent passages of text about a topic. We collect a large dataset of 300K\nhuman-written stories paired with writing prompts from an online forum. Our\ndataset enables hierarchical story generation, where the model first generates\na premise, and then transforms it into a passage of text. We gain further\nimprovements with a novel form of model fusion that improves the relevance of\nthe story to the prompt, and adding a new gated multi-scale self-attention\nmechanism to model long-range context. Experiments show large improvements over\nstrong baselines on both automated and human evaluations. Human judges prefer\nstories generated by our approach to those from a strong non-hierarchical model\nby a factor of two to one.",
