    "abstract": "This paper examines the task of detecting intensity of emotion from text. We\ncreate the first datasets of tweets annotated for anger, fear, joy, and sadness\nintensities. We use a technique called best--worst scaling (BWS) that improves\nannotation consistency and obtains reliable fine-grained scores. We show that\nemotion-word hashtags often impact emotion intensity, usually conveying a more\nintense emotion. Finally, we create a benchmark regression system and conduct\nexperiments to determine: which features are useful for detecting emotion\nintensity, and, the extent to which two emotions are similar in terms of how\nthey manifest in language.",
