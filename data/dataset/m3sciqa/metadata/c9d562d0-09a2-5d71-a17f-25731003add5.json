    "abstract": "Human use language not just to convey information but also to express their\ninner feelings and mental states. In this work, we adapt the state-of-the-art\nlanguage generation models to generate affective (emotional) text. We posit a\nmodel capable of generating affect-driven and topic-focused sentences without\nlosing grammatical correctness as the affect intensity increases. We propose to\nincorporate emotion as prior for the probabilistic state-of-the-art text\ngeneration model such as GPT-2. The model gives a user the flexibility to\ncontrol the category and intensity of emotion as well as the topic of the\ngenerated text. Previous attempts at modelling fine-grained emotions fall out\non grammatical correctness at extreme intensities, but our model is resilient\nto this and delivers robust results at all intensities. We conduct automated\nevaluations and human studies to test the performance of our model and provide\na detailed comparison of the results with other models. In all evaluations, our\nmodel outperforms existing affective text generation models.",
