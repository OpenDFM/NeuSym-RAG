    "abstract": "Existing personalized dialogue models use human designed persona descriptions\nto improve dialogue consistency. Collecting such descriptions from existing\ndialogues is expensive and requires hand-crafted feature designs. In this\npaper, we propose to extend Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)(Finn et al.,\n2017) to personalized dialogue learning without using any persona descriptions.\nOur model learns to quickly adapt to new personas by leveraging only a few\ndialogue samples collected from the same user, which is fundamentally different\nfrom conditioning the response on the persona descriptions. Empirical results\non Persona-chat dataset (Zhang et al., 2018) indicate that our solution\noutperforms non-meta-learning baselines using automatic evaluation metrics, and\nin terms of human-evaluated fluency and consistency.",
