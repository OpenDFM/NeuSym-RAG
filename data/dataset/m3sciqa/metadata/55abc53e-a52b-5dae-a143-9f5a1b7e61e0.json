    "abstract": "We present information value, a measure which quantifies the predictability\nof an utterance relative to a set of plausible alternatives. We introduce a\nmethod to obtain interpretable estimates of information value using neural text\ngenerators, and exploit their psychometric predictive power to investigate the\ndimensions of predictability that drive human comprehension behaviour.\nInformation value is a stronger predictor of utterance acceptability in written\nand spoken dialogue than aggregates of token-level surprisal and it is\ncomplementary to surprisal for predicting eye-tracked reading times.",
