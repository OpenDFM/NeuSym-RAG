    "abstract": "Entity retrieval, which aims at disambiguating mentions to canonical entities\nfrom massive KBs, is essential for many tasks in natural language processing.\nRecent progress in entity retrieval shows that the dual-encoder structure is a\npowerful and efficient framework to nominate candidates if entities are only\nidentified by descriptions. However, they ignore the property that meanings of\nentity mentions diverge in different contexts and are related to various\nportions of descriptions, which are treated equally in previous works. In this\nwork, we propose Multi-View Entity Representations (MuVER), a novel approach\nfor entity retrieval that constructs multi-view representations for entity\ndescriptions and approximates the optimal view for mentions via a heuristic\nsearching method. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nZESHEL and improves the quality of candidates on three standard Entity Linking\ndatasets",
