    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL parsing, which aims at converting natural language instructions\ninto executable SQLs, has gained increasing attention in recent years. In\nparticular, Codex and ChatGPT have shown impressive results in this task.\nHowever, most of the prevalent benchmarks, i.e., Spider, and WikiSQL, focus on\ndatabase schema with few rows of database contents leaving the gap between\nacademic study and real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, we present\nBird, a big benchmark for large-scale database grounded in text-to-SQL tasks,\ncontaining 12,751 pairs of text-to-SQL data and 95 databases with a total size\nof 33.4 GB, spanning 37 professional domains. Our emphasis on database values\nhighlights the new challenges of dirty database contents, external knowledge\nbetween NL questions and database contents, and SQL efficiency, particularly in\nthe context of massive databases. To solve these problems, text-to-SQL models\nmust feature database value comprehension in addition to semantic parsing. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the significance of database values in\ngenerating accurate text-to-SQLs for big databases. Furthermore, even the most\neffective text-to-SQL models, i.e. ChatGPT, only achieves 40.08% in execution\naccuracy, which is still far from the human result of 92.96%, proving that\nchallenges still stand. Besides, we also provide an efficiency analysis to\noffer insights into generating text-to-efficient-SQLs that are beneficial to\nindustries. We believe that BIRD will contribute to advancing real-world\napplications of text-to-SQL research. The leaderboard and source code are\navailable: https://bird-bench.github.io/.",
