    "abstract": "Hate speech has grown significantly on social media, causing serious\nconsequences for victims of all demographics. Despite much attention being paid\nto characterize and detect discriminatory speech, most work has focused on\nexplicit or overt hate speech, failing to address a more pervasive form based\non coded or indirect language. To fill this gap, this work introduces a\ntheoretically-justified taxonomy of implicit hate speech and a benchmark corpus\nwith fine-grained labels for each message and its implication. We present\nsystematic analyses of our dataset using contemporary baselines to detect and\nexplain implicit hate speech, and we discuss key features that challenge\nexisting models. This dataset will continue to serve as a useful benchmark for\nunderstanding this multifaceted issue.",
