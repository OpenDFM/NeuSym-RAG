    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) bring new opportunities to\nchallenging problems, especially those that need high-level intelligence, such\nas the math word problem (MWPs). However, directly applying existing PLMs to\nMWPs can fail as the generation process lacks sufficient supervision and thus\nlacks fast adaptivity as humans. We notice that human reasoning has a dual\nreasoning framework that consists of an immediate reaction system (system 1)\nand a delicate reasoning system (system 2), where the entire reasoning is\ndetermined by their interaction. This inspires us to develop a cooperative\nreasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe),\nresulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator\nand system 2 as the verifier. In our approach, the generator is responsible for\ngenerating reasoning paths, and the verifiers are used to supervise the\nevaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator. We evaluate\nour CoRe framework on several mathematical reasoning datasets and achieve\ndecent improvement over state-of-the-art methods, up to 9.6% increase over best\nbaselines.
