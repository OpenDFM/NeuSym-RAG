    "abstract": "Interpretability or explainability is an emerging research field in NLP. From\na user-centric point of view, the goal is to build models that provide proper\njustification for their decisions, similar to those of humans, by requiring the\nmodels to satisfy additional constraints. To this end, we introduce a new\napplication on legal text where, contrary to mainstream literature targeting\nword-level rationales, we conceive rationales as selected paragraphs in\nmulti-paragraph structured court cases. We also release a new dataset\ncomprising European Court of Human Rights cases, including annotations for\nparagraph-level rationales. We use this dataset to study the effect of already\nproposed rationale constraints, i.e., sparsity, continuity, and\ncomprehensiveness, formulated as regularizers. Our findings indicate that some\nof these constraints are not beneficial in paragraph-level rationale\nextraction, while others need re-formulation to better handle the multi-label\nnature of the task we consider. We also introduce a new constraint,\nsingularity, which further improves the quality of rationales, even compared\nwith noisy rationale supervision. Experimental results indicate that the newly\nintroduced task is very challenging and there is a large scope for further\nresearch.",
