    "abstract": "Named geographic entities (geo-entities for short) are the building blocks of\nmany geographic datasets. Characterizing geo-entities is integral to various\napplication domains, such as geo-intelligence and map comprehension, while a\nkey challenge is to capture the spatial-varying context of an entity. We\nhypothesize that we shall know the characteristics of a geo-entity by its\nsurrounding entities, similar to knowing word meanings by their linguistic\ncontext. Accordingly, we propose a novel spatial language model, SpaBERT, which\nprovides a general-purpose geo-entity representation based on neighboring\nentities in geospatial data. SpaBERT extends BERT to capture linearized spatial\ncontext, while incorporating a spatial coordinate embedding mechanism to\npreserve spatial relations of entities in the 2-dimensional space. SpaBERT is\npretrained with masked language modeling and masked entity prediction tasks to\nlearn spatial dependencies. We apply SpaBERT to two downstream tasks:\ngeo-entity typing and geo-entity linking. Compared with the existing language\nmodels that do not use spatial context, SpaBERT shows significant performance\nimprovement on both tasks. We also analyze the entity representation from\nSpaBERT in various settings and the effect of spatial coordinate embedding.",
