    "abstract": "In a customer service system, dialogue summarization can boost service\nefficiency by automatically creating summaries for long spoken dialogues in\nwhich customers and agents try to address issues about specific topics. In this\nwork, we focus on topic-oriented dialogue summarization, which generates highly\nabstractive summaries that preserve the main ideas from dialogues. In spoken\ndialogues, abundant dialogue noise and common semantics could obscure the\nunderlying informative content, making the general topic modeling approaches\ndifficult to apply. In addition, for customer service, role-specific\ninformation matters and is an indispensable part of a summary. To effectively\nperform topic modeling on dialogues and capture multi-role information, in this\nwork we propose a novel topic-augmented two-stage dialogue summarizer (TDS)\njointly with a saliency-aware neural topic model (SATM) for topic-oriented\nsummarization of customer service dialogues. Comprehensive studies on a\nreal-world Chinese customer service dataset demonstrated the superiority of our\nmethod against several strong baselines.",
