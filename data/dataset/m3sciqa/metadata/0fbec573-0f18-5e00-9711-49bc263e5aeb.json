    "abstract": "Despite the ability to train capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining\ntheir relevancy and rectifying errors remains elusive. To this end, the past\nfew years have witnessed a surge in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective\nof which is to efficiently alter the behavior of LLMs within a specific domain\nwithout negatively impacting performance across other inputs. This paper\nembarks on a deep exploration of the problems, methods, and opportunities\nrelated to model editing for LLMs. In particular, we provide an exhaustive\noverview of the task definition and challenges associated with model editing,\nalong with an in-depth empirical analysis of the most progressive methods\ncurrently at our disposal. We also build a new benchmark dataset to facilitate\na more robust evaluation and pinpoint enduring issues intrinsic to existing\ntechniques. Our objective is to provide valuable insights into the\neffectiveness and feasibility of each editing technique, thereby assisting the\ncommunity in making informed decisions on the selection of the most appropriate\nmethod for a specific task or context.
