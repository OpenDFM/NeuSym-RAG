    "abstract": "Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) exploits only a handful of\nannotations to identify and classify named entity mentions. Prototypical\nnetwork shows superior performance on few-shot NER. However, existing\nprototypical methods fail to differentiate rich semantics in other-class words,\nwhich will aggravate overfitting under few shot scenario. To address the issue,\nwe propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO),\nthat can automatically induce different undefined classes from the other class\nto improve few-shot NER. With these extra-labeled undefined classes, our method\nwill improve the discriminative ability of NER classifier and enhance the\nunderstanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms five\nstate-of-the-art models in both 1-shot and 5-shots settings on four NER\nbenchmarks. We will release the code upon acceptance. The source code is\nreleased on https: //github.com/shuaiwa16/OtherClassNER.git.",
