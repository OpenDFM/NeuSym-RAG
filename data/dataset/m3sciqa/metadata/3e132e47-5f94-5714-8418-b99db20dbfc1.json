    "abstract": "Training a task-completion dialogue agent via reinforcement learning (RL) is\ncostly because it requires many interactions with real users. One common\nalternative is to use a user simulator. However, a user simulator usually lacks\nthe language complexity of human interlocutors and the biases in its design may\ntend to degrade the agent. To address these issues, we present Deep Dyna-Q,\nwhich to our knowledge is the first deep RL framework that integrates planning\nfor task-completion dialogue policy learning. We incorporate into the dialogue\nagent a model of the environment, referred to as the world model, to mimic real\nuser response and generate simulated experience. During dialogue policy\nlearning, the world model is constantly updated with real user experience to\napproach real user behavior, and in turn, the dialogue agent is optimized using\nboth real experience and simulated experience. The effectiveness of our\napproach is demonstrated on a movie-ticket booking task in both simulated and\nhuman-in-the-loop settings.",
