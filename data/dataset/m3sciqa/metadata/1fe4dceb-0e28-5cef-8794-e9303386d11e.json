    "abstract": "Target-oriented dialogue systems, designed to proactively steer conversations\ntoward predefined targets or accomplish specific system-side goals, are an\nexciting area in conversational AI. In this work, by formulating a <dialogue\nact, topic> pair as the conversation target, we explore a novel problem of\npersonalized target-oriented dialogue by considering personalization during the\ntarget accomplishment process. However, there remains an emergent need for\nhigh-quality datasets, and building one from scratch requires tremendous human\neffort. To address this, we propose an automatic dataset curation framework\nusing a role-playing approach. Based on this framework, we construct a\nlarge-scale personalized target-oriented dialogue dataset, TopDial, which\ncomprises about 18K multi-turn dialogues. The experimental results show that\nthis dataset is of high quality and could contribute to exploring personalized\ntarget-oriented dialogue.",
