    "abstract": "Form understanding is a challenging problem which aims to recognize semantic\nentities from the input document and their hierarchical relations. Previous\napproaches face significant difficulty dealing with the complexity of the task,\nthus treat these objectives separately. To this end, we present a novel deep\nneural network to jointly perform both entity detection and link prediction in\nan end-to-end fashion. Our model extends the Multi-stage Attentional U-Net\narchitecture with the Part-Intensity Fields and Part-Association Fields for\nlink prediction, enriching the spatial information flow with the additional\nsupervision from entity linking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the model\non the Form Understanding in Noisy Scanned Documents (FUNSD) dataset, where our\nmethod substantially outperforms the original model and state-of-the-art\nbaselines in both Entity Labeling and Entity Linking task.",
