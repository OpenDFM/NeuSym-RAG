    "abstract": "We survey 146 papers analyzing \"bias\" in NLP systems, finding that their\nmotivations are often vague, inconsistent, and lacking in normative reasoning,\ndespite the fact that analyzing \"bias\" is an inherently normative process. We\nfurther find that these papers' proposed quantitative techniques for measuring\nor mitigating \"bias\" are poorly matched to their motivations and do not engage\nwith the relevant literature outside of NLP. Based on these findings, we\ndescribe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations\nthat should guide work analyzing \"bias\" in NLP systems. These recommendations\nrest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social\nhierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their\nconceptualizations of \"bias\"---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are\nharmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning\nunderlying these statements---and to center work around the lived experiences\nof members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and\nreimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.",
