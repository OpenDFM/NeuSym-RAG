    "abstract": "Question-answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) was proposed as an\nattractive open and natural flavour of SRL, potentially attainable from laymen.\nRecently, a large-scale crowdsourced QA-SRL corpus and a trained parser were\nreleased. Trying to replicate the QA-SRL annotation for new texts, we found\nthat the resulting annotations were lacking in quality, particularly in\ncoverage, making them insufficient for further research and evaluation. In this\npaper, we present an improved crowdsourcing protocol for complex semantic\nannotation, involving worker selection and training, and a data consolidation\nphase. Applying this protocol to QA-SRL yielded high-quality annotation with\ndrastically higher coverage, producing a new gold evaluation dataset. We\nbelieve that our annotation protocol and gold standard will facilitate future\nreplicable research of natural semantic annotations.",
