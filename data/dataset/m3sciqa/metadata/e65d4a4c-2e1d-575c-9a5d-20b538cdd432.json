    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a popular method for KG reasoning and\ntraining KGEs with higher dimension are usually preferred since they have\nbetter reasoning capability. However, high-dimensional KGEs pose huge\nchallenges to storage and computing resources and are not suitable for\nresource-limited or time-constrained applications, for which faster and cheaper\nreasoning is necessary. To address this problem, we propose DualDE, a knowledge\ndistillation method to build low-dimensional student KGE from pre-trained\nhigh-dimensional teacher KGE. DualDE considers the dual-influence between the\nteacher and the student. In DualDE, we propose a soft label evaluation\nmechanism to adaptively assign different soft label and hard label weights to\ndifferent triples, and a two-stage distillation approach to improve the\nstudent's acceptance of the teacher. Our DualDE is general enough to be applied\nto various KGEs. Experimental results show that our method can successfully\nreduce the embedding parameters of a high-dimensional KGE by 7 times - 15 times\nand increase the inference speed by 2 times - 6 times while retaining a high\nperformance. We also experimentally prove the effectiveness of our soft label\nevaluation mechanism and two-stage distillation approach via ablation study.",
