    "abstract": "Generative dialogue models currently suffer from a number of problems which\nstandard maximum likelihood training does not address. They tend to produce\ngenerations that (i) rely too much on copying from the context, (ii) contain\nrepetitions within utterances, (iii) overuse frequent words, and (iv) at a\ndeeper level, contain logical flaws. In this work we show how all of these\nproblems can be addressed by extending the recently introduced unlikelihood\nloss (Welleck et al., 2019) to these cases. We show that appropriate loss\nfunctions which regularize generated outputs to match human distributions are\neffective for the first three issues. For the last important general issue, we\nshow applying unlikelihood to collected data of what a model should not do is\neffective for improving logical consistency, potentially paving the way to\ngenerative models with greater reasoning ability. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our approach across several dialogue tasks.",
