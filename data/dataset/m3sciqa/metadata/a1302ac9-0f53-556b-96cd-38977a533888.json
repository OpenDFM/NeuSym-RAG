    "abstract": "In this work, we study hallucinations in Neural Machine Translation (NMT),\nwhich lie at an extreme end on the spectrum of NMT pathologies. Firstly, we\nconnect the phenomenon of hallucinations under source perturbation to the\nLong-Tail theory of Feldman (2020), and present an empirically validated\nhypothesis that explains hallucinations under source perturbation. Secondly, we\nconsider hallucinations under corpus-level noise (without any source\nperturbation) and demonstrate that two prominent types of natural\nhallucinations (detached and oscillatory outputs) could be generated and\nexplained through specific corpus-level noise patterns. Finally, we elucidate\nthe phenomenon of hallucination amplification in popular data-generation\nprocesses such as Backtranslation and sequence-level Knowledge Distillation.",
