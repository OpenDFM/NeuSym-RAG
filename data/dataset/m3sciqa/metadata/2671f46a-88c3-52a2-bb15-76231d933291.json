    "abstract": "This study investigates the task of knowledge-based question generation\n(KBQG). Conventional KBQG works generated questions from fact triples in the\nknowledge graph, which could not express complex operations like aggregation\nand comparison in SPARQL. Moreover, due to the costly annotation of large-scale\nSPARQL-question pairs, KBQG from SPARQL under low-resource scenarios urgently\nneeds to be explored. Recently, since the generative pre-trained language\nmodels (PLMs) typically trained in natural language (NL)-to-NL paradigm have\nbeen proven effective for low-resource generation, e.g., T5 and BART, how to\neffectively utilize them to generate NL-question from non-NL SPARQL is\nchallenging. To address these challenges, AutoQGS, an auto-prompt approach for\nlow-resource KBQG from SPARQL, is proposed. Firstly, we put forward to generate\nquestions directly from SPARQL for the KBQG task to handle complex operations.\nSecondly, we propose an auto-prompter trained on large-scale unsupervised data\nto rephrase SPARQL into NL description, smoothing the low-resource\ntransformation from non-NL SPARQL to NL question with PLMs. Experimental\nresults on the WebQuestionsSP, ComlexWebQuestions 1.1, and PathQuestions show\nthat our model achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in\nlow-resource settings. Furthermore, a corpus of 330k factoid complex\nquestion-SPARQL pairs is generated for further KBQG research.",
