    "abstract": "The BigCode community, an open-scientific collaboration working on the\nresponsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs),\nintroduces StarCoder and StarCoderBase: 15.5B parameter models with 8K context\nlength, infilling capabilities and fast large-batch inference enabled by\nmulti-query attention. StarCoderBase is trained on 1 trillion tokens sourced\nfrom The Stack, a large collection of permissively licensed GitHub repositories\nwith inspection tools and an opt-out process. We fine-tuned StarCoderBase on\n35B Python tokens, resulting in the creation of StarCoder. We perform the most\ncomprehensive evaluation of Code LLMs to date and show that StarCoderBase\noutperforms every open Code LLM that supports multiple programming languages\nand matches or outperforms the OpenAI code-cushman-001 model. Furthermore,\nStarCoder outperforms every model that is fine-tuned on Python, can be prompted\nto achieve 40\\% pass@1 on HumanEval, and still retains its performance on other\nprogramming languages. We take several important steps towards a safe\nopen-access model release, including an improved PII redaction pipeline and a\nnovel attribution tracing tool, and make the StarCoder models publicly\navailable under a more commercially viable version of the Open Responsible AI\nModel license.",
