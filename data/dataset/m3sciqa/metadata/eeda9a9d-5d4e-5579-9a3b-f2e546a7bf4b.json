    "abstract": "When searching for information, a human reader first glances over a document,\nspots relevant sections and then focuses on a few sentences for resolving her\nintention. However, the high variance of document structure complicates to\nidentify the salient topic of a given section at a glance. To tackle this\nchallenge, we present SECTOR, a model to support machine reading systems by\nsegmenting documents into coherent sections and assigning topic labels to each\nsection. Our deep neural network architecture learns a latent topic embedding\nover the course of a document. This can be leveraged to classify local topics\nfrom plain text and segment a document at topic shifts. In addition, we\ncontribute WikiSection, a publicly available dataset with 242k labeled sections\nin English and German from two distinct domains: diseases and cities. From our\nextensive evaluation of 20 architectures, we report a highest score of 71.6% F1\nfor the segmentation and classification of 30 topics from the English city\ndomain, scored by our SECTOR LSTM model with bloom filter embeddings and\nbidirectional segmentation. This is a significant improvement of 29.5 points F1\ncompared to state-of-the-art CNN classifiers with baseline segmentation.",
