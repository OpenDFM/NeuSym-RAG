    "abstract": "Labelled data is the foundation of most natural language processing tasks.\nHowever, labelling data is difficult and there often are diverse valid beliefs\nabout what the correct data labels should be. So far, dataset creators have\nacknowledged annotator subjectivity, but rarely actively managed it in the\nannotation process. This has led to partly-subjective datasets that fail to\nserve a clear downstream use. To address this issue, we propose two contrasting\nparadigms for data annotation. The descriptive paradigm encourages annotator\nsubjectivity, whereas the prescriptive paradigm discourages it. Descriptive\nannotation allows for the surveying and modelling of different beliefs, whereas\nprescriptive annotation enables the training of models that consistently apply\none belief. We discuss benefits and challenges in implementing both paradigms,\nand argue that dataset creators should explicitly aim for one or the other to\nfacilitate the intended use of their dataset. Lastly, we conduct an annotation\nexperiment using hate speech data that illustrates the contrast between the two\nparadigms.",
