    "abstract": "Reading order detection is the cornerstone to understanding visually-rich\ndocuments (e.g., receipts and forms). Unfortunately, no existing work took\nadvantage of advanced deep learning models because it is too laborious to\nannotate a large enough dataset. We observe that the reading order of WORD\ndocuments is embedded in their XML metadata; meanwhile, it is easy to convert\nWORD documents to PDFs or images. Therefore, in an automated manner, we\nconstruct ReadingBank, a benchmark dataset that contains reading order, text,\nand layout information for 500,000 document images covering a wide spectrum of\ndocument types. This first-ever large-scale dataset unleashes the power of deep\nneural networks for reading order detection. Specifically, our proposed\nLayoutReader captures the text and layout information for reading order\nprediction using the seq2seq model. It performs almost perfectly in reading\norder detection and significantly improves both open-source and commercial OCR\nengines in ordering text lines in their results in our experiments. We will\nrelease the dataset and model at \\url{https://aka.ms/layoutreader}.",
