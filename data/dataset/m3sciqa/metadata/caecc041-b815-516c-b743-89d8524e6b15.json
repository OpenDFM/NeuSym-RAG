    "abstract": "Modern methods in dimensionality reduction are dominated by nonlinear\nattraction-repulsion force-based methods (this includes t-SNE, UMAP,\nForceAtlas2, LargeVis, and many more). The purpose of this paper is to\ndemonstrate that all such methods, by design, come with an additional feature\nthat is being automatically computed along the way, namely the vector field\nassociated with these forces. We show how this vector field gives additional\nhigh-quality information and propose a general refinement strategy based on\nideas from Morse theory. The efficiency of these ideas is illustrated\nspecifically using t-SNE on synthetic and real-life data sets.",
