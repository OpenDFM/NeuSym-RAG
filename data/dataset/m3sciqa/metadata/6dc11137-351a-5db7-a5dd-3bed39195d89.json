    "abstract": "Normalizing flows attempt to model an arbitrary probability distribution\nthrough a set of invertible mappings. These transformations are required to\nachieve a tractable Jacobian determinant that can be used in high-dimensional\nscenarios. The first normalizing flow designs used coupling layer mappings\nbuilt upon affine transformations. The significant advantage of such models is\ntheir easy-to-compute inverse. Nevertheless, making use of affine\ntransformations may limit the expressiveness of such models. Recently,\ninvertible piecewise polynomial functions as a replacement for affine\ntransformations have attracted attention. However, these methods require\nsolving a polynomial equation to calculate their inverse. In this paper, we\nexplore using linear rational splines as a replacement for affine\ntransformations used in coupling layers. Besides having a straightforward\ninverse, inference and generation have similar cost and architecture in this\nmethod. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate the competitiveness of this\napproach's performance compared to existing methods.",
