    "abstract": "Humans can understand and produce new utterances effortlessly, thanks to\ntheir compositional skills. Once a person learns the meaning of a new verb\n\"dax,\" he or she can immediately understand the meaning of \"dax twice\" or \"sing\nand dax.\" In this paper, we introduce the SCAN domain, consisting of a set of\nsimple compositional navigation commands paired with the corresponding action\nsequences. We then test the zero-shot generalization capabilities of a variety\nof recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on SCAN with sequence-to-sequence\nmethods. We find that RNNs can make successful zero-shot generalizations when\nthe differences between training and test commands are small, so that they can\napply \"mix-and-match\" strategies to solve the task. However, when\ngeneralization requires systematic compositional skills (as in the \"dax\"\nexample above), RNNs fail spectacularly. We conclude with a proof-of-concept\nexperiment in neural machine translation, suggesting that lack of systematicity\nmight be partially responsible for neural networks' notorious training data\nthirst.",
