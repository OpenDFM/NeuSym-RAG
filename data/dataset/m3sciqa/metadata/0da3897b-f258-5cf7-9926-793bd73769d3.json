    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of chat-based language models has led to remarkable\nprogress in complex task-solving. However, their success heavily relies on\nhuman input to guide the conversation, which can be challenging and\ntime-consuming. This paper explores the potential of building scalable\ntechniques to facilitate autonomous cooperation among communicative agents, and\nprovides insight into their \"cognitive\" processes. To address the challenges of\nachieving autonomous cooperation, we propose a novel communicative agent\nframework named role-playing. Our approach involves using inception prompting\nto guide chat agents toward task completion while maintaining consistency with\nhuman intentions. We showcase how role-playing can be used to generate\nconversational data for studying the behaviors and capabilities of a society of\nagents, providing a valuable resource for investigating conversational language\nmodels. In particular, we conduct comprehensive studies on\ninstruction-following cooperation in multi-agent settings. Our contributions\ninclude introducing a novel communicative agent framework, offering a scalable\napproach for studying the cooperative behaviors and capabilities of multi-agent\nsystems, and open-sourcing our library to support research on communicative\nagents and beyond: https://github.com/camel-ai/camel.",
