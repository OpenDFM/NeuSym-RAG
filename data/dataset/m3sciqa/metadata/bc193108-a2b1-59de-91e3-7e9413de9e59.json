    "abstract": "Generative search engines directly generate responses to user queries, along\nwith in-line citations. A prerequisite trait of a trustworthy generative search\nengine is verifiability, i.e., systems should cite comprehensively (high\ncitation recall; all statements are fully supported by citations) and\naccurately (high citation precision; every cite supports its associated\nstatement). We conduct human evaluation to audit four popular generative search\nengines -- Bing Chat, NeevaAI, perplexity.ai, and YouChat -- across a diverse\nset of queries from a variety of sources (e.g., historical Google user queries,\ndynamically-collected open-ended questions on Reddit, etc.). We find that\nresponses from existing generative search engines are fluent and appear\ninformative, but frequently contain unsupported statements and inaccurate\ncitations: on average, a mere 51.5% of generated sentences are fully supported\nby citations and only 74.5% of citations support their associated sentence. We\nbelieve that these results are concerningly low for systems that may serve as a\nprimary tool for information-seeking users, especially given their facade of\ntrustworthiness. We hope that our results further motivate the development of\ntrustworthy generative search engines and help researchers and users better\nunderstand the shortcomings of existing commercial systems.",
