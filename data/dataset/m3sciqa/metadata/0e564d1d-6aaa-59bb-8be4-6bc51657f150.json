    "abstract": "Knowledge-grounded conversation (KGC) shows excellent potential to deliver an\nengaging and informative response. However, existing approaches emphasize\nselecting one golden knowledge given a particular dialogue context, overlooking\nthe one-to-many phenomenon in dialogue. As a result, the existing paradigm\nlimits the diversity of knowledge selection and generation. To this end, we\nestablish a multi-reference KGC dataset and propose a series of metrics to\nsystematically assess the one-to-many efficacy of existing KGC models.\nFurthermore, to extend the hypothesis space of knowledge selection to enhance\nthe mapping relationship between multiple knowledge and multiple responses, we\ndevise a span-based variational model and optimize the model in a wake-sleep\nstyle with an ameliorated evidence lower bound objective to learn the\none-to-many generalization. Both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach.",
