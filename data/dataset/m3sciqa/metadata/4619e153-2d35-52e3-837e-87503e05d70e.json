    "abstract": "Due to the significance and value in human-computer interaction and natural\nlanguage processing, task-oriented dialog systems are attracting more and more\nattention in both academic and industrial communities. In this paper, we survey\nrecent advances and challenges in task-oriented dialog systems. We also discuss\nthree critical topics for task-oriented dialog systems: (1) improving data\nefficiency to facilitate dialog modeling in low-resource settings, (2) modeling\nmulti-turn dynamics for dialog policy learning to achieve better\ntask-completion performance, and (3) integrating domain ontology knowledge into\nthe dialog model. Besides, we review the recent progresses in dialog evaluation\nand some widely-used corpora. We believe that this survey, though incomplete,\ncan shed a light on future research in task-oriented dialog systems.",
