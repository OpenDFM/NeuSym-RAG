    "abstract": "The PDTB-3 contains many more Implicit discourse relations than the previous\nPDTB-2. This is in part because implicit relations have now been annotated\nwithin sentences as well as between them. In addition, some now co-occur with\nexplicit discourse relations, instead of standing on their own. Here we show\nthat while this can complicate the problem of identifying the location of\nimplicit discourse relations, it can in turn simplify the problem of\nidentifying their senses. We present data to support this claim, as well as\nmethods that can serve as a non-trivial baseline for future state-of-the-art\nrecognizers for implicit discourse relations.",
