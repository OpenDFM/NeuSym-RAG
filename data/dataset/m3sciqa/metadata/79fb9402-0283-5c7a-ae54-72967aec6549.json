    "abstract": "To build a conversational agent that interacts fluently with humans, previous\nstudies blend knowledge or personal profile into the pre-trained language\nmodel. However, the model that considers knowledge and persona at the same time\nis still limited, leading to hallucination and a passive way of using personas.\nWe propose an effective dialogue agent that grounds external knowledge and\npersona simultaneously. The agent selects the proper knowledge and persona to\nuse for generating the answers with our candidate scoring implemented with a\npoly-encoder. Then, our model generates the utterance with lesser hallucination\nand more engagingness utilizing retrieval augmented generation with\nknowledge-persona enhanced query. We conduct experiments on the\npersona-knowledge chat and achieve state-of-the-art performance in grounding\nand generation tasks on the automatic metrics. Moreover, we validate the\nanswers from the models regarding hallucination and engagingness through human\nevaluation and qualitative results. We show our retriever's effectiveness in\nextracting relevant documents compared to the other previous retrievers, along\nwith the comparison of multiple candidate scoring methods.
