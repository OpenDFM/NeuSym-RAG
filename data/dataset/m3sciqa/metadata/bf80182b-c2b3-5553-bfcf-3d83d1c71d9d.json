    "abstract": "Reasoning, as an essential ability for complex problem-solving, can provide\nback-end support for various real-world applications, such as medical\ndiagnosis, negotiation, etc. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of\ncutting-edge research on reasoning with language model prompting. We introduce\nresearch works with comparisons and summaries and provide systematic resources\nto help beginners. We also discuss the potential reasons for emerging such\nreasoning abilities and highlight future research directions. Resources are\navailable at https://github.com/zjunlp/Prompt4ReasoningPapers (updated\nperiodically).",
