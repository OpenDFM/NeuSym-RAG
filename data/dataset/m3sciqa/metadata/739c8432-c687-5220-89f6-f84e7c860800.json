    "abstract": "Despite showing increasingly human-like conversational abilities,\nstate-of-the-art dialogue models often suffer from factual incorrectness and\nhallucination of knowledge (Roller et al., 2020). In this work we explore the\nuse of neural-retrieval-in-the-loop architectures - recently shown to be\neffective in open-domain QA (Lewis et al., 2020b; Izacard and Grave, 2020) -\nfor knowledge-grounded dialogue, a task that is arguably more challenging as it\nrequires querying based on complex multi-turn dialogue context and generating\nconversationally coherent responses. We study various types of architectures\nwith multiple components - retrievers, rankers, and encoder-decoders - with the\ngoal of maximizing knowledgeability while retaining conversational ability. We\ndemonstrate that our best models obtain state-of-the-art performance on two\nknowledge-grounded conversational tasks. The models exhibit open-domain\nconversational capabilities, generalize effectively to scenarios not within the\ntraining data, and, as verified by human evaluations, substantially reduce the\nwell-known problem of knowledge hallucination in state-of-the-art chatbots.",
