    "abstract": "In NMT we search for the mode of the model distribution to form predictions.\nThe mode and other high-probability translations found by beam search have been\nshown to often be inadequate in a number of ways. This prevents improving\ntranslation quality through better search, as these idiosyncratic translations\nend up selected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search\ncurse. Recently, an approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding has been\nproposed as an alternative decision rule that would likely not suffer from the\nsame problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that it has no\nequivalent to the beam search curse. We then design approximations that\ndecouple the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of expected\nutility. This allows for much larger hypothesis spaces, which we show to be\nbeneficial. We also show that mode-seeking strategies can aid in constructing\ncompact sets of promising hypotheses and that MBR is effective in identifying\ngood translations in them. We conduct experiments on three language pairs\nvarying in amounts of resources available: English into and from German,\nRomanian, and Nepali.",
