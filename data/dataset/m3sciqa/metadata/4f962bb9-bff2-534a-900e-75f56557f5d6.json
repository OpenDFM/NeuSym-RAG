    "abstract": "A good conversation requires balance -- between simplicity and detail;\nstaying on topic and changing it; asking questions and answering them. Although\ndialogue agents are commonly evaluated via human judgments of overall quality,\nthe relationship between quality and these individual factors is less\nwell-studied. In this work, we examine two controllable neural text generation\nmethods, conditional training and weighted decoding, in order to control four\nimportant attributes for chitchat dialogue: repetition, specificity,\nresponse-relatedness and question-asking. We conduct a large-scale human\nevaluation to measure the effect of these control parameters on multi-turn\ninteractive conversations on the PersonaChat task. We provide a detailed\nanalysis of their relationship to high-level aspects of conversation, and show\nthat by controlling combinations of these variables our models obtain clear\nimprovements in human quality judgments.",
