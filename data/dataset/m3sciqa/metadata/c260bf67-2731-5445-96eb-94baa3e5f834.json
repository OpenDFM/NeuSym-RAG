    "abstract": "Humans usually have conversations by making use of prior knowledge about a\ntopic and background information of the people whom they are talking to.\nHowever, existing conversational agents and datasets do not consider such\ncomprehensive information, and thus they have a limitation in generating the\nutterances where the knowledge and persona are fused properly. To address this\nissue, we introduce a call For Customized conversation (FoCus) dataset where\nthe customized answers are built with the user's persona and Wikipedia\nknowledge. To evaluate the abilities to make informative and customized\nutterances of pre-trained language models, we utilize BART and GPT-2 as well as\ntransformer-based models. We assess their generation abilities with automatic\nscores and conduct human evaluations for qualitative results. We examine\nwhether the model reflects adequate persona and knowledge with our proposed two\nsub-tasks, persona grounding (PG) and knowledge grounding (KG). Moreover, we\nshow that the utterances of our data are constructed with the proper knowledge\nand persona through grounding quality assessment.",
