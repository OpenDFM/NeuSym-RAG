    "abstract": "Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential and\nstructural information. Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by\nhumans in the text format describing proteins' high-level functionalities. Yet,\nwhether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has\nnot been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal\nframework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT\nconsists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP which aligns the representation\nof two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from\nthe text modality, and a decoder that creates the protein sequences from the\nrepresentation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset,\nSwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify the\neffectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90% accuracy\nfor text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shot\ntext-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of six\nprotein property prediction benchmarks.",
