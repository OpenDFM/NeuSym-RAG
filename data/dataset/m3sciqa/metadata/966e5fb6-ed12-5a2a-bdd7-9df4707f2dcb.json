    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) have become the norm in NLP, demonstrating\ngood performance in generation and reasoning tasks, one of its most fatal\ndisadvantages is the lack of factual correctness. Generating unfactual texts\nnot only leads to lower performances but also degrades the trust and validity\nof their applications. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves trust and\nmodel performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating interpretable\nreasoning chains, but still suffers from factuality concerns in\nknowledge-intensive tasks. In this paper, we propose the Verify-and-Edit\nframework for CoT prompting, which seeks to increase prediction factuality by\npost-editing reasoning chains according to external knowledge. Building on top\nof GPT-3, our framework lead to accuracy improvements in multiple open-domain\nquestion-answering tasks.",
