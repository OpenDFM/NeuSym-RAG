    "abstract": "This paper explores the task of Difficulty-Controllable Question Generation\n(DCQG), which aims at generating questions with required difficulty levels.\nPrevious research on this task mainly defines the difficulty of a question as\nwhether it can be correctly answered by a Question Answering (QA) system,\nlacking interpretability and controllability. In our work, we redefine question\ndifficulty as the number of inference steps required to answer it and argue\nthat Question Generation (QG) systems should have stronger control over the\nlogic of generated questions. To this end, we propose a novel framework that\nprogressively increases question difficulty through step-by-step rewriting\nunder the guidance of an extracted reasoning chain. A dataset is automatically\nconstructed to facilitate the research, on which extensive experiments are\nconducted to test the performance of our method.",
