    "abstract": "Previous math word problem solvers following the encoder-decoder paradigm\nfail to explicitly incorporate essential math symbolic constraints, leading to\nunexplainable and unreasonable predictions. Herein, we propose Neural-Symbolic\nSolver (NS-Solver) to explicitly and seamlessly incorporate different levels of\nsymbolic constraints by auxiliary tasks. Our NS-Solver consists of a problem\nreader to encode problems, a programmer to generate symbolic equations, and a\nsymbolic executor to obtain answers. Along with target expression supervision,\nour solver is also optimized via 4 new auxiliary objectives to enforce\ndifferent symbolic reasoning: a) self-supervised number prediction task\npredicting both number quantity and number locations; b) commonsense constant\nprediction task predicting what prior knowledge (e.g. how many legs a chicken\nhas) is required; c) program consistency checker computing the semantic loss\nbetween predicted equation and target equation to ensure reasonable equation\nmapping; d) duality exploiting task exploiting the quasi duality between\nsymbolic equation generation and problem's part-of-speech generation to enhance\nthe understanding ability of a solver. Besides, to provide a more realistic and\nchallenging benchmark for developing a universal and scalable solver, we also\nconstruct a new large-scale MWP benchmark CM17K consisting of 4 kinds of MWPs\n(arithmetic, one-unknown linear, one-unknown non-linear, equation set) with\nmore than 17K samples. Extensive experiments on Math23K and our CM17k\ndemonstrate the superiority of our NS-Solver compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods.",
