    "abstract": "We investigate the less-explored task of generating open-ended questions that\nare typically answered by multiple sentences. We first define a new question\ntype ontology which differentiates the nuanced nature of questions better than\nwidely used question words. A new dataset with 4,959 questions is labeled based\non the new ontology. We then propose a novel question type-aware question\ngeneration framework, augmented by a semantic graph representation, to jointly\npredict question focuses and produce the question. Based on this framework, we\nfurther use both exemplars and automatically generated templates to improve\ncontrollability and diversity. Experiments on two newly collected large-scale\ndatasets show that our model improves question quality over competitive\ncomparisons based on automatic metrics. Human judges also rate our model\noutputs highly in answerability, coverage of scope, and overall quality.\nFinally, our model variants with templates can produce questions with enhanced\ncontrollability and diversity.",
