    "abstract": "Generating mathematical equations from natural language requires an accurate\nunderstanding of the relations among math expressions. Existing approaches can\nbe broadly categorized into token-level and expression-level generation. The\nformer treats equations as a mathematical language, sequentially generating\nmath tokens. Expression-level methods generate each expression one by one.\nHowever, each expression represents a solving step, and there naturally exist\nparallel or dependent relations between these steps, which are ignored by\ncurrent sequential methods. Therefore, we integrate tree structure into the\nexpression-level generation and advocate an expression tree decoding strategy.\nTo generate a tree with expression as its node, we employ a layer-wise parallel\ndecoding strategy: we decode multiple independent expressions (leaf nodes) in\nparallel at each layer and repeat parallel decoding layer by layer to\nsequentially generate these parent node expressions that depend on others.\nBesides, a bipartite matching algorithm is adopted to align multiple\npredictions with annotations for each layer. Experiments show our method\noutperforms other baselines, especially for these equations with complex\nstructures.",
