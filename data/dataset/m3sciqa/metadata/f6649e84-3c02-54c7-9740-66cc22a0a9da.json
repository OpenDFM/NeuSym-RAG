    "abstract": "The charge prediction task is to determine appropriate charges for a given\ncase, which is helpful for legal assistant systems where the user input is fact\ndescription. We argue that relevant law articles play an important role in this\ntask, and therefore propose an attention-based neural network method to jointly\nmodel the charge prediction task and the relevant article extraction task in a\nunified framework. The experimental results show that, besides providing legal\nbasis, the relevant articles can also clearly improve the charge prediction\nresults, and our full model can effectively predict appropriate charges for\ncases with different expression styles.",
