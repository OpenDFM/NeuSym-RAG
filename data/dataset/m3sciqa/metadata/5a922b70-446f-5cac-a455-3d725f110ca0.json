    "abstract": "We propose a language-agnostic way of automatically generating sets of\nsemantically similar clusters of entities along with sets of \"outlier\"\nelements, which may then be used to perform an intrinsic evaluation of word\nembeddings in the outlier detection task. We used our methodology to create a\ngold-standard dataset, which we call WikiSem500, and evaluated multiple\nstate-of-the-art embeddings. The results show a correlation between performance\non this dataset and performance on sentiment analysis.",
