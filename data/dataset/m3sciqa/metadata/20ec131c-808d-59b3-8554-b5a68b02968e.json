    "abstract": "We propose MultiDoc2Dial, a new task and dataset on modeling goal-oriented\ndialogues grounded in multiple documents. Most previous works treat\ndocument-grounded dialogue modeling as a machine reading comprehension task\nbased on a single given document or passage. In this work, we aim to address\nmore realistic scenarios where a goal-oriented information-seeking conversation\ninvolves multiple topics, and hence is grounded on different documents. To\nfacilitate such a task, we introduce a new dataset that contains dialogues\ngrounded in multiple documents from four different domains. We also explore\nmodeling the dialogue-based and document-based context in the dataset. We\npresent strong baseline approaches and various experimental results, aiming to\nsupport further research efforts on such a task.",
