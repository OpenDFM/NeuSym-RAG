    "abstract": "Question answering (QA) is a fundamental means to facilitate assessment and\ntraining of narrative comprehension skills for both machines and young\nchildren, yet there is scarcity of high-quality QA datasets carefully designed\nto serve this purpose. In particular, existing datasets rarely distinguish\nfine-grained reading skills, such as the understanding of varying narrative\nelements. Drawing on the reading education research, we introduce FairytaleQA,\na dataset focusing on narrative comprehension of kindergarten to eighth-grade\nstudents. Generated by educational experts based on an evidence-based\ntheoretical framework, FairytaleQA consists of 10,580 explicit and implicit\nquestions derived from 278 children-friendly stories, covering seven types of\nnarrative elements or relations. Our dataset is valuable in two folds: First,\nwe ran existing QA models on our dataset and confirmed that this annotation\nhelps assess models' fine-grained learning skills. Second, the dataset supports\nquestion generation (QG) task in the education domain. Through benchmarking\nwith QG models, we show that the QG model trained on FairytaleQA is capable of\nasking high-quality and more diverse questions.",
