    "abstract": "We introduce extreme summarization, a new single-document summarization task\nwhich does not favor extractive strategies and calls for an abstractive\nmodeling approach. The idea is to create a short, one-sentence news summary\nanswering the question \"What is the article about?\". We collect a real-world,\nlarge-scale dataset for this task by harvesting online articles from the\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). We propose a novel abstractive model\nwhich is conditioned on the article's topics and based entirely on\nconvolutional neural networks. We demonstrate experimentally that this\narchitecture captures long-range dependencies in a document and recognizes\npertinent content, outperforming an oracle extractive system and\nstate-of-the-art abstractive approaches when evaluated automatically and by\nhumans.",
