    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep neural models allow us to build reliable named entity\nrecognition (NER) systems without handcrafting features. However, such methods\nrequire large amounts of manually-labeled training data. There have been\nefforts on replacing human annotations with distant supervision (in conjunction\nwith external dictionaries), but the generated noisy labels pose significant\nchallenges on learning effective neural models. Here we propose two neural\nmodels to suit noisy distant supervision from the dictionary. First, under the\ntraditional sequence labeling framework, we propose a revised fuzzy CRF layer\nto handle tokens with multiple possible labels. After identifying the nature of\nnoisy labels in distant supervision, we go beyond the traditional framework and\npropose a novel, more effective neural model AutoNER with a new Tie or Break\nscheme. In addition, we discuss how to refine distant supervision for better\nNER performance. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat AutoNER achieves the best performance when only using dictionaries with no\nadditional human effort, and delivers competitive results with state-of-the-art\nsupervised benchmarks.",
