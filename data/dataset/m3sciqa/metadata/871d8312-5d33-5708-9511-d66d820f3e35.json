    "abstract": "Simultaneous machine translation begins to translate each source sentence\nbefore the source speaker is finished speaking, with applications to live and\nstreaming scenarios. Simultaneous systems must carefully schedule their reading\nof the source sentence to balance quality against latency. We present the first\nsimultaneous translation system to learn an adaptive schedule jointly with a\nneural machine translation (NMT) model that attends over all source tokens read\nthus far. We do so by introducing Monotonic Infinite Lookback (MILk) attention,\nwhich maintains both a hard, monotonic attention head to schedule the reading\nof the source sentence, and a soft attention head that extends from the\nmonotonic head back to the beginning of the source. We show that MILk's\nadaptive schedule allows it to arrive at latency-quality trade-offs that are\nfavorable to those of a recently proposed wait-k strategy for many latency\nvalues.",
