    "abstract": "Large language models have a range of beneficial uses: they can assist in\nprose, poetry, and programming; analyze dataset biases; and more. However,\ntheir flexibility and generative capabilities also raise misuse concerns. This\nreport discusses OpenAI's work related to the release of its GPT-2 language\nmodel. It discusses staged release, which allows time between model releases to\nconduct risk and benefit analyses as model sizes increased. It also discusses\nongoing partnership-based research and provides recommendations for better\ncoordination and responsible publication in AI.",
