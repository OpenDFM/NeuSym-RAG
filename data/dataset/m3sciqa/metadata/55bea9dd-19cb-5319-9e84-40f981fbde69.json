    "abstract": "Target-guided response generation enables dialogue systems to smoothly\ntransition a conversation from a dialogue context toward a target sentence.\nSuch control is useful for designing dialogue systems that direct a\nconversation toward specific goals, such as creating non-obtrusive\nrecommendations or introducing new topics in the conversation. In this paper,\nwe introduce a new technique for target-guided response generation, which first\nfinds a bridging path of commonsense knowledge concepts between the source and\nthe target, and then uses the identified bridging path to generate transition\nresponses. Additionally, we propose techniques to re-purpose existing dialogue\ndatasets for target-guided generation. Experiments reveal that the proposed\ntechniques outperform various baselines on this task. Finally, we observe that\nthe existing automated metrics for this task correlate poorly with human\njudgement ratings. We propose a novel evaluation metric that we demonstrate is\nmore reliable for target-guided response evaluation. Our work generally enables\ndialogue system designers to exercise more control over the conversations that\ntheir systems produce.",
