    "abstract": "This work describes an automatic news chatbot that draws content from a\ndiverse set of news articles and creates conversations with a user about the\nnews. Key components of the system include the automatic organization of news\narticles into topical chatrooms, integration of automatically generated\nquestions into the conversation, and a novel method for choosing which\nquestions to present which avoids repetitive suggestions. We describe the\nalgorithmic framework and present the results of a usability study that shows\nthat news readers using the system successfully engage in multi-turn\nconversations about specific news stories.",
