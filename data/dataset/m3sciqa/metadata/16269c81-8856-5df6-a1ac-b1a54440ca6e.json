    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs enable a wide variety of applications, including question\nanswering and information retrieval. Despite the great effort invested in their\ncreation and maintenance, even the largest (e.g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata)\nremain incomplete. We introduce Relational Graph Convolutional Networks\n(R-GCNs) and apply them to two standard knowledge base completion tasks: Link\nprediction (recovery of missing facts, i.e. subject-predicate-object triples)\nand entity classification (recovery of missing entity attributes). R-GCNs are\nrelated to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are\ndeveloped specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data\ncharacteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show\nthat factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be\nsignificantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model to accumulate\nevidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a\nlarge improvement of 29.8% on FB15k-237 over a decoder-only baseline.",
