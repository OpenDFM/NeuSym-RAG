    "abstract": "Typical fact verification models use retrieved written evidence to verify\nclaims. Evidence sources, however, often change over time as more information\nis gathered and revised. In order to adapt, models must be sensitive to subtle\ndifferences in supporting evidence. We present VitaminC, a benchmark infused\nwith challenging cases that require fact verification models to discern and\nadjust to slight factual changes. We collect over 100,000 Wikipedia revisions\nthat modify an underlying fact, and leverage these revisions, together with\nadditional synthetically constructed ones, to create a total of over 400,000\nclaim-evidence pairs. Unlike previous resources, the examples in VitaminC are\ncontrastive, i.e., they contain evidence pairs that are nearly identical in\nlanguage and content, with the exception that one supports a given claim while\nthe other does not. We show that training using this design increases\nrobustness -- improving accuracy by 10% on adversarial fact verification and 6%\non adversarial natural language inference (NLI). Moreover, the structure of\nVitaminC leads us to define additional tasks for fact-checking resources:\ntagging relevant words in the evidence for verifying the claim, identifying\nfactual revisions, and providing automatic edits via factually consistent text\ngeneration.",
