    "abstract": "Empirical methods in geoparsing have thus far lacked a standard evaluation\nframework describing the task, metrics and data used to compare\nstate-of-the-art systems. Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even\nunrepresentative of real-world usage by the lack of distinction between the\ndifferent types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation\nof metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity\nRecognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript\nintroduces a new framework in three parts. Part 1) Task Definition: clarified\nvia corpus linguistic analysis proposing a fine-grained Pragmatic Taxonomy of\nToponyms. Part 2) Metrics: discussed and reviewed for a rigorous evaluation\nincluding recommendations for NER/Geoparsing practitioners. Part 3) Evaluation\nData: shared via a new dataset called GeoWebNews to provide test/train examples\nand enable immediate use of our contributions. In addition to fine-grained\nGeotagging and Toponym Resolution (Geocoding), this dataset is also suitable\nfor prototyping and evaluating machine learning NLP models.",
