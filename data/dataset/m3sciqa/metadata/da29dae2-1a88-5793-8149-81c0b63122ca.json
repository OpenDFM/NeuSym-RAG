    "abstract": "This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed\nseveral large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional\nnetworks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are\noffered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their\nTFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and\nrecurrent neural networks.",
