    "abstract": "Denoising is the essential step for distant supervision based named entity\nrecognition. Previous denoising methods are mostly based on instance-level\nconfidence statistics, which ignore the variety of the underlying noise\ndistribution on different datasets and entity types. This makes them difficult\nto be adapted to high noise rate settings. In this paper, we propose\nHypergeometric Learning (HGL), a denoising algorithm for distantly supervised\nNER that takes both noise distribution and instance-level confidence into\nconsideration. Specifically, during neural network training, we naturally model\nthe noise samples in each batch following a hypergeometric distribution\nparameterized by the noise-rate. Then each instance in the batch is regarded as\neither correct or noisy one according to its label confidence derived from\nprevious training step, as well as the noise distribution in this sampled\nbatch. Experiments show that HGL can effectively denoise the weakly-labeled\ndata retrieved from distant supervision, and therefore results in significant\nimprovements on the trained models.",
