    "abstract": "Forgetting refers to the loss or deterioration of previously acquired\nknowledge. While existing surveys on forgetting have primarily focused on\ncontinual learning, forgetting is a prevalent phenomenon observed in various\nother research domains within deep learning. Forgetting manifests in research\nfields such as generative models due to generator shifts, and federated\nlearning due to heterogeneous data distributions across clients. Addressing\nforgetting encompasses several challenges, including balancing the retention of\nold task knowledge with fast learning of new task, managing task interference\nwith conflicting goals, and preventing privacy leakage, etc. Moreover, most\nexisting surveys on continual learning implicitly assume that forgetting is\nalways harmful. In contrast, our survey argues that forgetting is a\ndouble-edged sword and can be beneficial and desirable in certain cases, such\nas privacy-preserving scenarios. By exploring forgetting in a broader context,\nwe present a more nuanced understanding of this phenomenon and highlight its\npotential advantages. Through this comprehensive survey, we aspire to uncover\npotential solutions by drawing upon ideas and approaches from various fields\nthat have dealt with forgetting. By examining forgetting beyond its\nconventional boundaries, we hope to encourage the development of novel\nstrategies for mitigating, harnessing, or even embracing forgetting in real\napplications. A comprehensive list of papers about forgetting in various\nresearch fields is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/EnnengYang/Awesome-Forgetting-in-Deep-Learning}.",
