    "abstract": "Open domain response generation has achieved remarkable progress in recent\nyears, but sometimes yields short and uninformative responses. We propose a new\nparadigm for response generation, that is response generation by editing, which\nsignificantly increases the diversity and informativeness of the generation\nresults. Our assumption is that a plausible response can be generated by\nslightly revising an existing response prototype. The prototype is retrieved\nfrom a pre-defined index and provides a good start-point for generation because\nit is grammatical and informative. We design a response editing model, where an\nedit vector is formed by considering differences between a prototype context\nand a current context, and then the edit vector is fed to a decoder to revise\nthe prototype response for the current context. Experiment results on a large\nscale dataset demonstrate that the response editing model outperforms\ngenerative and retrieval-based models on various aspects.",
