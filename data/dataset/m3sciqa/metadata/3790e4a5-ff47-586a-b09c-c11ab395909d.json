    "abstract": "Text segmentation, the task of dividing a document into contiguous segments\nbased on its semantic structure, is a longstanding challenge in language\nunderstanding. Previous work on text segmentation focused on unsupervised\nmethods such as clustering or graph search, due to the paucity in labeled data.\nIn this work, we formulate text segmentation as a supervised learning problem,\nand present a large new dataset for text segmentation that is automatically\nextracted and labeled from Wikipedia. Moreover, we develop a segmentation model\nbased on this dataset and show that it generalizes well to unseen natural text.",
