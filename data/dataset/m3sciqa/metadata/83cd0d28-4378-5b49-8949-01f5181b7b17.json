    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital to safety-critical machine\nlearning applications and has thus been extensively studied, with a plethora of\nmethods developed in the literature. However, the field currently lacks a\nunified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often results\nin unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. From the problem setting\nperspective, OOD detection is closely related to neighboring fields including\nanomaly detection (AD), open set recognition (OSR), and model uncertainty,\nsince methods developed for one domain are often applicable to each other. To\nhelp the community to improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified,\nwell-structured codebase called OpenOOD, which implements over 30 methods\ndeveloped in relevant fields and provides a comprehensive benchmark under the\nrecently proposed generalized OOD detection framework. With a comprehensive\ncomparison of these methods, we are gratified that the field has progressed\nsignificantly over the past few years, where both preprocessing methods and the\northogonal post-hoc methods show strong potential.",
