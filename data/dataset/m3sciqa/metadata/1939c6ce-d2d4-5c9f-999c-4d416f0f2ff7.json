    "abstract": "While normalizing flows have led to significant advances in modeling\nhigh-dimensional continuous distributions, their applicability to discrete\ndistributions remains unknown. In this paper, we show that flows can in fact be\nextended to discrete events---and under a simple change-of-variables formula\nnot requiring log-determinant-Jacobian computations. Discrete flows have\nnumerous applications. We consider two flow architectures: discrete\nautoregressive flows that enable bidirectionality, allowing, for example,\ntokens in text to depend on both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts in an\nexact language model; and discrete bipartite flows that enable efficient\nnon-autoregressive generation as in RealNVP. Empirically, we find that discrete\nautoregressive flows outperform autoregressive baselines on synthetic discrete\ndistributions, an addition task, and Potts models; and bipartite flows can\nobtain competitive performance with autoregressive baselines on character-level\nlanguage modeling for Penn Tree Bank and text8.",
