    "abstract": "Access to word-sentiment associations is useful for many applications,\nincluding sentiment analysis, stance detection, and linguistic analysis.\nHowever, manually assigning fine-grained sentiment association scores to words\nhas many challenges with respect to keeping annotations consistent. We apply\nthe annotation technique of Best-Worst Scaling to obtain real-valued sentiment\nassociation scores for words and phrases in three different domains: general\nEnglish, English Twitter, and Arabic Twitter. We show that on all three domains\nthe ranking of words by sentiment remains remarkably consistent even when the\nannotation process is repeated with a different set of annotators. We also, for\nthe first time, determine the minimum difference in sentiment association that\nis perceptible to native speakers of a language.",
