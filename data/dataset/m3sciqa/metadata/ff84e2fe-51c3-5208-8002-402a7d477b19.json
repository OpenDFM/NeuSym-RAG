    "abstract": "We present a semantic parser for Abstract Meaning Representations which\nlearns to parse strings into tree representations of the compositional\nstructure of an AMR graph. This allows us to use standard neural techniques for\nsupertagging and dependency tree parsing, constrained by a linguistically\nprincipled type system. We present two approximative decoding algorithms, which\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy and outperform strong baselines.",
