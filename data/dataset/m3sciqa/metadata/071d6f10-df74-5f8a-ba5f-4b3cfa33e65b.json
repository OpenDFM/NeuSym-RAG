    "abstract": "Accurate entity linkers have been produced for domains and languages where\nannotated data (i.e., texts linked to a knowledge base) is available. However,\nlittle progress has been made for the settings where no or very limited amounts\nof labeled data are present (e.g., legal or most scientific domains). In this\nwork, we show how we can learn to link mentions without having any labeled\nexamples, only a knowledge base and a collection of unannotated texts from the\ncorresponding domain. In order to achieve this, we frame the task as a\nmulti-instance learning problem and rely on surface matching to create initial\nnoisy labels. As the learning signal is weak and our surrogate labels are\nnoisy, we introduce a noise detection component in our model: it lets the model\ndetect and disregard examples which are likely to be noisy. Our method, jointly\nlearning to detect noise and link entities, greatly outperforms the surface\nmatching baseline. For a subset of entity categories, it even approaches the\nperformance of supervised learning.",
