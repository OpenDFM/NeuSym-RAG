    "abstract": "Nigerian English adaptation, Pidgin, has evolved over the years through\nmulti-language code switching, code mixing and linguistic adaptation. While\nPidgin preserves many of the words in the normal English language corpus, both\nin spelling and pronunciation, the fundamental meaning of these words have\nchanged significantly. For example,'ginger' is not a plant but an expression of\nmotivation and 'tank' is not a container but an expression of gratitude. The\nimplication is that the current approach of using direct English sentiment\nanalysis of social media text from Nigeria is sub-optimal, as it will not be\nable to capture the semantic variation and contextual evolution in the\ncontemporary meaning of these words. In practice, while many words in Nigerian\nPidgin adaptation are the same as the standard English, the full English\nlanguage based sentiment analysis models are not designed to capture the full\nintent of the Nigerian pidgin when used alone or code-mixed. By augmenting\nscarce human labelled code-changed text with ample synthetic code-reformatted\ntext and meaning, we achieve significant improvements in sentiment scoring. Our\nresearch explores how to understand sentiment in an intrasentential code mixing\nand switching context where there has been significant word localization.This\nwork presents a 300 VADER lexicon compatible Nigerian Pidgin sentiment tokens\nand their scores and a 14,000 gold standard Nigerian Pidgin tweets and their\nsentiments labels.",
