    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to automatically solving arithmetic word\nproblems. This is the first algorithmic approach that can handle arithmetic\nproblems with multiple steps and operations, without depending on additional\nannotations or predefined templates. We develop a theory for expression trees\nthat can be used to represent and evaluate the target arithmetic expressions;\nwe use it to uniquely decompose the target arithmetic problem to multiple\nclassification problems; we then compose an expression tree, combining these\nwith world knowledge through a constrained inference framework. Our classifiers\ngain from the use of {\\em quantity schemas} that supports better extraction of\nfeatures. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing\nsystems, achieving state of the art performance on benchmark datasets of\narithmetic word problems.",
