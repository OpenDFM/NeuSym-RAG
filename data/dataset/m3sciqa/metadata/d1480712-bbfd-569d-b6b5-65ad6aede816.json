    "abstract": "End-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems aim to generate system responses\ndirectly from plain text inputs. There are two challenges for such systems: one\nis how to effectively incorporate external knowledge bases (KBs) into the\nlearning framework; the other is how to accurately capture the semantics of\ndialogue history. In this paper, we address these two challenges by exploiting\nthe graph structural information in the knowledge base and in the dependency\nparsing tree of the dialogue. To effectively leverage the structural\ninformation in dialogue history, we propose a new recurrent cell architecture\nwhich allows representation learning on graphs. To exploit the relations\nbetween entities in KBs, the model combines multi-hop reasoning ability based\non the graph structure. Experimental results show that the proposed model\nachieves consistent improvement over state-of-the-art models on two different\ntask-oriented dialogue datasets.",
