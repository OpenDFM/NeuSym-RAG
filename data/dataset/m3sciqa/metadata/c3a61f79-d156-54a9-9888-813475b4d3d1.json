    "abstract": "Topic segmentation of meetings is the task of dividing multi-person meeting\ntranscripts into topic blocks. Supervised approaches to the problem have proven\nintractable due to the difficulties in collecting and accurately annotating\nlarge datasets. In this paper we show how previous unsupervised topic\nsegmentation methods can be improved using pre-trained neural architectures. We\nintroduce an unsupervised approach based on BERT embeddings that achieves a\n15.5% reduction in error rate over existing unsupervised approaches applied to\ntwo popular datasets for meeting transcripts.",
