    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit math word problems~(MWPs) from the cross-lingual\nand multilingual perspective. We construct our MWP solvers over pretrained\nmultilingual language models using sequence-to-sequence model with copy\nmechanism. We compare how the MWP solvers perform in cross-lingual and\nmultilingual scenarios. To facilitate the comparison of cross-lingual\nperformance, we first adapt the large-scale English dataset MathQA as a\ncounterpart of the Chinese dataset Math23K. Then we extend several English\ndatasets to bilingual datasets through machine translation plus human\nannotation. Our experiments show that the MWP solvers may not be transferred to\na different language even if the target expressions have the same operator set\nand constants. But for both cross-lingual and multilingual cases, it can be\nbetter generalized if problem types exist on both source language and target\nlanguage.",
