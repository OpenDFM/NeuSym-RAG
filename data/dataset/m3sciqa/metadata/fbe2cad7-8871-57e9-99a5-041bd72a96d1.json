    "abstract": "Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications\nranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal\ncommunication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative\nagents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior.\nGenerative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint,\nwhile authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate\nconversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next\nday. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a\nlarge language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences\nusing natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level\nreflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate\ngenerative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by\nThe Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents\nusing natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce\nbelievable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with\nonly a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's\nDay party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the\nnext two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the\nparty, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We\ndemonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent\narchitecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically\nto the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with\ncomputational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and\ninteraction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.",
