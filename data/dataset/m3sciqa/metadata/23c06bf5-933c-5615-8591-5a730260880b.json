    "abstract": "Automatic question generation (QG) is a challenging problem in natural\nlanguage understanding. QG systems are typically built assuming access to a\nlarge number of training instances where each instance is a question and its\ncorresponding answer. For a new language, such training instances are hard to\nobtain making the QG problem even more challenging. Using this as our\nmotivation, we study the reuse of an available large QG dataset in a secondary\nlanguage (e.g. English) to learn a QG model for a primary language (e.g. Hindi)\nof interest. For the primary language, we assume access to a large amount of\nmonolingual text but only a small QG dataset. We propose a cross-lingual QG\nmodel which uses the following training regime: (i) Unsupervised pretraining of\nlanguage models in both primary and secondary languages and (ii) joint\nsupervised training for QG in both languages. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nour proposed approach using two different primary languages, Hindi and Chinese.\nWe also create and release a new question answering dataset for Hindi\nconsisting of 6555 sentences.",
