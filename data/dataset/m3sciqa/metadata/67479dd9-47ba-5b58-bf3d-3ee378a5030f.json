    "abstract": "We aim to improve question answering (QA) by decomposing hard questions into\nsimpler sub-questions that existing QA systems are capable of answering. Since\nlabeling questions with decompositions is cumbersome, we take an unsupervised\napproach to produce sub-questions, also enabling us to leverage millions of\nquestions from the internet. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for One-to-N\nUnsupervised Sequence transduction (ONUS) that learns to map one hard,\nmulti-hop question to many simpler, single-hop sub-questions. We answer\nsub-questions with an off-the-shelf QA model and give the resulting answers to\na recomposition model that combines them into a final answer. We show large QA\nimprovements on HotpotQA over a strong baseline on the original, out-of-domain,\nand multi-hop dev sets. ONUS automatically learns to decompose different kinds\nof questions, while matching the utility of supervised and heuristic\ndecomposition methods for QA and exceeding those methods in fluency.\nQualitatively, we find that using sub-questions is promising for shedding light\non why a QA system makes a prediction.",
