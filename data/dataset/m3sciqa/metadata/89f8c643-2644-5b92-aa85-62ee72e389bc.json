    "abstract": "As one of the challenging NLP tasks, designing math word problem (MWP)\nsolvers has attracted increasing research attention for the past few years. In\nprevious work, models designed by taking into account the properties of the\nbinary tree structure of mathematical expressions at the output side have\nachieved better performance. However, the expressions corresponding to a MWP\nare often diverse (e.g., $n_1+n_2 \\times n_3-n_4$, $n_3\\times n_2-n_4+n_1$,\netc.), and so are the corresponding binary trees, which creates difficulties in\nmodel learning due to the non-deterministic output space. In this paper, we\npropose the Structure-Unified M-Tree Coding Solver (SUMC-Solver), which applies\na tree with any M branches (M-tree) to unify the output structures. To learn\nthe M-tree, we use a mapping to convert the M-tree into the M-tree codes, where\ncodes store the information of the paths from tree root to leaf nodes and the\ninformation of leaf nodes themselves, and then devise a Sequence-to-Code\n(seq2code) model to generate the codes. Experimental results on the widely used\nMAWPS and Math23K datasets have demonstrated that SUMC-Solver not only\noutperforms several state-of-the-art models under similar experimental settings\nbut also performs much better under low-resource conditions.",
