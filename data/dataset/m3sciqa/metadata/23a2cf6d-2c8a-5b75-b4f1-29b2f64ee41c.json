    "abstract": "Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance\nacross a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which\ndrastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to\nadapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of\nthe impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter,\ndensely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language\nModel PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML\nsystem which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We\ndemonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art\nfew-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation\nbenchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough\nperformance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of\nmulti-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the\nrecently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks\nshowed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance\nsteeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong\ncapabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we\ndemonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a\ncomprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training\ndata memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical\nconsiderations related to large language models and discuss potential\nmitigation strategies.",
