    "abstract": "As LLMs become commonplace, machine-generated text has the potential to flood\nthe internet with spam, social media bots, and valueless content. Watermarking\nis a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such harms by enabling the\ndetection and documentation of LLM-generated text. Yet a crucial question\nremains: How reliable is watermarking in realistic settings in the wild? There,\nwatermarked text may be modified to suit a user's needs, or entirely rewritten\nto avoid detection. We study the robustness of watermarked text after it is\nre-written by humans, paraphrased by a non-watermarked LLM, or mixed into a\nlonger hand-written document. We find that watermarks remain detectable even\nafter human and machine paraphrasing. While these attacks dilute the strength\nof the watermark, paraphrases are statistically likely to leak n-grams or even\nlonger fragments of the original text, resulting in high-confidence detections\nwhen enough tokens are observed. For example, after strong human paraphrasing\nthe watermark is detectable after observing 800 tokens on average, when setting\na 1e-5 false positive rate. We also consider a range of new detection schemes\nthat are sensitive to short spans of watermarked text embedded inside a large\ndocument, and we compare the robustness of watermarking to other kinds of\ndetectors.",
