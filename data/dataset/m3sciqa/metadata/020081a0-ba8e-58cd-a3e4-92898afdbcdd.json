    "abstract": "Optical character recognition (OCR) technology has been widely used in\nvarious scenes, as shown in Figure 1. Designing a practical OCR system is still\na meaningful but challenging task. In previous work, considering the efficiency\nand accuracy, we proposed a practical ultra lightweight OCR system (PP-OCR),\nand an optimized version PP-OCRv2. In order to further improve the performance\nof PP-OCRv2, a more robust OCR system PP-OCRv3 is proposed in this paper.\nPP-OCRv3 upgrades the text detection model and text recognition model in 9\naspects based on PP-OCRv2. For text detector, we introduce a PAN module with\nlarge receptive field named LK-PAN, a FPN module with residual attention\nmechanism named RSE-FPN, and DML distillation strategy. For text recognizer,\nthe base model is replaced from CRNN to SVTR, and we introduce lightweight text\nrecognition network SVTR LCNet, guided training of CTC by attention, data\naugmentation strategy TextConAug, better pre-trained model by self-supervised\nTextRotNet, UDML, and UIM to accelerate the model and improve the effect.\nExperiments on real data show that the hmean of PP-OCRv3 is 5% higher than\nPP-OCRv2 under comparable inference speed. All the above mentioned models are\nopen-sourced and the code is available in the GitHub repository PaddleOCR which\nis powered by PaddlePaddle.",
