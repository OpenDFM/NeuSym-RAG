    "abstract": "The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis posits a preference among\nlanguage users for utterances structured such that information is distributed\nuniformly across a signal. While its implications on language production have\nbeen well explored, the hypothesis potentially makes predictions about language\ncomprehension and linguistic acceptability as well. Further, it is unclear how\nuniformity in a linguistic signal -- or lack thereof -- should be measured, and\nover which linguistic unit, e.g., the sentence or language level, this\nuniformity should hold. Here we investigate these facets of the UID hypothesis\nusing reading time and acceptability data. While our reading time results are\ngenerally consistent with previous work, they are also consistent with a weakly\nsuper-linear effect of surprisal, which would be compatible with UID's\npredictions. For acceptability judgments, we find clearer evidence that\nnon-uniformity in information density is predictive of lower acceptability. We\nthen explore multiple operationalizations of UID, motivated by different\ninterpretations of the original hypothesis, and analyze the scope over which\nthe pressure towards uniformity is exerted. The explanatory power of a subset\nof the proposed operationalizations suggests that the strongest trend may be a\nregression towards a mean surprisal across the language, rather than the\nphrase, sentence, or document -- a finding that supports a typical\ninterpretation of UID, namely that it is the byproduct of language users\nmaximizing the use of a (hypothetical) communication channel.",
