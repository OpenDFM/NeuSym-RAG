    "abstract": "We present BRIDGE, a powerful sequential architecture for modeling\ndependencies between natural language questions and relational databases in\ncross-DB semantic parsing. BRIDGE represents the question and DB schema in a\ntagged sequence where a subset of the fields are augmented with cell values\nmentioned in the question. The hybrid sequence is encoded by BERT with minimal\nsubsequent layers and the text-DB contextualization is realized via the\nfine-tuned deep attention in BERT. Combined with a pointer-generator decoder\nwith schema-consistency driven search space pruning, BRIDGE attained\nstate-of-the-art performance on popular cross-DB text-to-SQL benchmarks, Spider\n(71.1\\% dev, 67.5\\% test with ensemble model) and WikiSQL (92.6\\% dev, 91.9\\%\ntest). Our analysis shows that BRIDGE effectively captures the desired\ncross-modal dependencies and has the potential to generalize to more text-DB\nrelated tasks. Our implementation is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/salesforce/TabularSemanticParsing}.",
