    "abstract": "Information Extraction (IE) for semi-structured document images is often\napproached as a sequence tagging problem by classifying each recognized input\ntoken into one of the IOB (Inside, Outside, and Beginning) categories. However,\nsuch problem setup has two inherent limitations that (1) it cannot easily\nhandle complex spatial relationships and (2) it is not suitable for highly\nstructured information, which are nevertheless frequently observed in\nreal-world document images. To tackle these issues, we first formulate the IE\ntask as spatial dependency parsing problem that focuses on the relationship\namong text tokens in the documents. Under this setup, we then propose SPADE\n(SPAtial DEpendency parser) that models highly complex spatial relationships\nand an arbitrary number of information layers in the documents in an end-to-end\nmanner. We evaluate it on various kinds of documents such as receipts, name\ncards, forms, and invoices, and show that it achieves a similar or better\nperformance compared to strong baselines including BERT-based IOB taggger.",
