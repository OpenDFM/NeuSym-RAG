    "abstract": "Recent advancements in pre-trained language models have enabled convenient\nmethods for generating human-like text at a large scale. Though these\ngeneration capabilities hold great potential for breakthrough applications, it\ncan also be a tool for an adversary to generate misinformation. In particular,\nsocial media platforms like Twitter are highly susceptible to AI-generated\nmisinformation. A potential threat scenario is when an adversary hijacks a\ncredible user account and incorporates a natural language generator to generate\nmisinformation. Such threats necessitate automated detectors for AI-generated\ntweets in a given user's Twitter timeline. However, tweets are inherently\nshort, thus making it difficult for current state-of-the-art pre-trained\nlanguage model-based detectors to accurately detect at what point the AI starts\nto generate tweets in a given Twitter timeline. In this paper, we present a\nnovel algorithm using stylometric signals to aid detecting AI-generated tweets.\nWe propose models corresponding to quantifying stylistic changes in human and\nAI tweets in two related tasks: Task 1 - discriminate between human and\nAI-generated tweets, and Task 2 - detect if and when an AI starts to generate\ntweets in a given Twitter timeline. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe stylometric features are effective in augmenting the state-of-the-art\nAI-generated text detectors.",
