    "abstract": "Humans exhibit garden path effects: When reading sentences that are\ntemporarily structurally ambiguous, they slow down when the structure is\ndisambiguated in favor of the less preferred alternative. Surprisal theory\n(Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes\nthat these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that\noccur in these sentences. Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel & Linzen\n(2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from\nlanguage models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path\neffects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the\nfact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than\nlanguage models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability\nfrom a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic\npredictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability\nindependently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of\ngarden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is\nindependently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of\nhuman garden path effects. Our results support the hypothesis that\npredictability is not the only factor responsible for the processing cost\nassociated with garden path sentences.",
