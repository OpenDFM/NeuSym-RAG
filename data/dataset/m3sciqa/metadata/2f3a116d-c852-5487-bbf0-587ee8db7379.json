    "abstract": "We present a new resource for the NLP community, namely a large (3.5M+\nsentence) knowledge base of *generic statements*, e.g., \"Trees remove carbon\ndioxide from the atmosphere\", collected from multiple corpora. This is the\nfirst large resource to contain *naturally occurring* generic sentences, as\nopposed to extracted or crowdsourced triples, and thus is rich in high-quality,\ngeneral, semantically complete statements. All GenericsKB sentences are\nannotated with their topical term, surrounding context (sentences), and a\n(learned) confidence. We also release GenericsKB-Best (1M+ sentences),\ncontaining the best-quality generics in GenericsKB augmented with selected,\nsynthesized generics from WordNet and ConceptNet. In tests on two existing\ndatasets requiring multihop reasoning (OBQA and QASC), we find using GenericsKB\ncan result in higher scores and better explanations than using a much larger\ncorpus. This demonstrates that GenericsKB can be a useful resource for NLP\napplications, as well as providing data for linguistic studies of generics and\ntheir semantics. GenericsKB is available at\nhttps://allenai.org/data/genericskb.",
