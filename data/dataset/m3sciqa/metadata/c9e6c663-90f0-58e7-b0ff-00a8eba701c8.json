    "abstract": "Performing simple household tasks based on language directives is very\nnatural to humans, yet it remains an open challenge for AI agents. The\n'interactive instruction following' task attempts to make progress towards\nbuilding agents that jointly navigate, interact, and reason in the environment\nat every step. To address the multifaceted problem, we propose a model that\nfactorizes the task into interactive perception and action policy streams with\nenhanced components and name it as MOCA, a Modular Object-Centric Approach. We\nempirically validate that MOCA outperforms prior arts by significant margins on\nthe ALFRED benchmark with improved generalization.",
