    "abstract": "The performance of automatic summarization models has improved dramatically\nin recent years. Yet, there is still a gap in meeting specific information\nneeds of users in real-world scenarios, particularly when a targeted summary is\nsought, such as in the useful aspect-based summarization setting targeted in\nthis paper. Previous datasets and studies for this setting have predominantly\nconcentrated on a limited set of pre-defined aspects, focused solely on single\ndocument inputs, or relied on synthetic data. To advance research on more\nrealistic scenarios, we introduce OpenAsp, a benchmark for multi-document\n\\textit{open} aspect-based summarization. This benchmark is created using a\nnovel and cost-effective annotation protocol, by which an open aspect dataset\nis derived from existing generic multi-document summarization datasets. We\nanalyze the properties of OpenAsp showcasing its high-quality content. Further,\nwe show that the realistic open-aspect setting realized in OpenAsp poses a\nchallenge for current state-of-the-art summarization models, as well as for\nlarge language models.",
