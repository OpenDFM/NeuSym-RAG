    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the named entity recognition (NER) problem under\ndistant supervision. Due to the incompleteness of the external dictionaries\nand/or knowledge bases, such distantly annotated training data usually suffer\nfrom a high false negative rate. To this end, we formulate the Distantly\nSupervised NER (DS-NER) problem via Multi-class Positive and Unlabeled (MPU)\nlearning and propose a theoretically and practically novel CONFidence-based MPU\n(Conf-MPU) approach. To handle the incomplete annotations, Conf-MPU consists of\ntwo steps. First, a confidence score is estimated for each token of being an\nentity token. Then, the proposed Conf-MPU risk estimation is applied to train a\nmulti-class classifier for the NER task. Thorough experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets labeled by various external knowledge demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed Conf-MPU over existing DS-NER methods.",
