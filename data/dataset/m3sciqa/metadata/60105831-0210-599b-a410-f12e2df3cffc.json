    "abstract": "Grounding human-machine conversation in a document is an effective way to\nimprove the performance of retrieval-based chatbots. However, only a part of\nthe document content may be relevant to help select the appropriate response at\na round. It is thus crucial to select the part of document content relevant to\nthe current conversation context. In this paper, we propose a document content\nselection network (CSN) to perform explicit selection of relevant document\ncontents, and filter out the irrelevant parts. We show in experiments on two\npublic document-grounded conversation datasets that CSN can effectively help\nselect the relevant document contents to the conversation context, and it\nproduces better results than the state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and\ndatasets are available at https://github.com/DaoD/CSN.",
