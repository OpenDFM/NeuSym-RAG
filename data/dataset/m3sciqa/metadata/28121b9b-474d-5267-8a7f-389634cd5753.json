    "abstract": "Solving math word problem (MWP) with AI techniques has recently made great\nprogress with the success of deep neural networks (DNN), but it is far from\nbeing solved. We argue that the ability of learning by analogy is essential for\nan MWP solver to better understand same problems which may typically be\nformulated in diverse ways. However most existing works exploit the shortcut\nlearning to train MWP solvers simply based on samples with a single question.\nIn lack of diverse questions, these methods merely learn shallow heuristics. In\nthis paper, we make a first attempt to solve MWPs by generating diverse yet\nconsistent questions/equations. Given a typical MWP including the scenario\ndescription, question, and equation (i.e., answer), we first generate multiple\nconsistent equations via a group of heuristic rules. We then feed them to a\nquestion generator together with the scenario to obtain the corresponding\ndiverse questions, forming a new MWP with a variety of questions and equations.\nFinally we engage a data filter to remove those unreasonable MWPs, keeping the\nhigh-quality augmented ones. To evaluate the ability of learning by analogy for\nan MWP solver, we generate a new MWP dataset (called DiverseMath23K) with\ndiverse questions by extending the current benchmark Math23K. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can generate\nhigh-quality diverse questions with corresponding equations, further leading to\nperformance improvement on Diverse-Math23K. The code and dataset is available\nat: https://github.com/zhouzihao501/DiverseMWP",
