    "abstract": "Hate speech is a challenging issue plaguing the online social media. While\nbetter models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there\nis little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In\nthis paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset\ncovering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated\nfrom three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class\nclassification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e.,\nthe community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the\npost), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their\nlabelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing\nstate-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in\nclassification do not score high on explainability metrics like model\nplausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the\nhuman rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias\ntowards target communities. We have made our code and dataset public at\nhttps://github.com/punyajoy/HateXplain",
