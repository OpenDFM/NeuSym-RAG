    "abstract": "Dialogue topic segmentation is critical in several dialogue modeling\nproblems. However, popular unsupervised approaches only exploit surface\nfeatures in assessing topical coherence among utterances. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by leveraging supervisory signals from the\nutterance-pair coherence scoring task. First, we present a simple yet effective\nstrategy to generate a training corpus for utterance-pair coherence scoring.\nThen, we train a BERT-based neural utterance-pair coherence model with the\nobtained training corpus. Finally, such model is used to measure the topical\nrelevance between utterances, acting as the basis of the segmentation\ninference. Experiments on three public datasets in English and Chinese\ndemonstrate that our proposal outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",
