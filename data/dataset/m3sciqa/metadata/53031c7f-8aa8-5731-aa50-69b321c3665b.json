    "abstract": "We present the Bayesian Case Model (BCM), a general framework for Bayesian\ncase-based reasoning (CBR) and prototype classification and clustering. BCM\nbrings the intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative framework. The BCM\nlearns prototypes, the \"quintessential\" observations that best represent\nclusters in a dataset, by performing joint inference on cluster labels,\nprototypes and important features. Simultaneously, BCM pursues sparsity by\nlearning subspaces, the sets of features that play important roles in the\ncharacterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation\nprovides quantitative benefits in interpretability while preserving\nclassification accuracy. Human subject experiments verify statistically\nsignificant improvements to participants' understanding when using explanations\nproduced by BCM, compared to those given by prior art.",
