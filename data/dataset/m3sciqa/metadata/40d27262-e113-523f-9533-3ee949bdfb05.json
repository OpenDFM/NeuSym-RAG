    "abstract": "Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) focuses on enhancing text-only\ntranslation with visual features, which has attracted considerable attention\nfrom both natural language processing and computer vision communities. Recent\nadvances still struggle to train a separate model for each language pair, which\nis costly and unaffordable when the number of languages increases in the real\nworld. In other words, the multilingual multimodal machine translation\n(Multilingual MMT) task has not been investigated, which aims to handle the\naforementioned issues by providing a shared semantic space for multiple\nlanguages. Besides, the image modality has no language boundaries, which is\nsuperior to bridging the semantic gap between languages. To this end, we first\npropose the Multilingual MMT task by establishing two new Multilingual MMT\nbenchmark datasets covering seven languages. Then, an effective baseline LVP-M3\nusing visual prompts is proposed to support translations between different\nlanguages, which includes three stages (token encoding, language-aware visual\nprompt generation, and language translation). Extensive experimental results on\nour constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LVP-M3\nmethod for Multilingual MMT.",
