    "abstract": "Math word problem (MWP) solving is an important task in question answering\nwhich requires human-like reasoning ability. Analogical reasoning has long been\nused in mathematical education, as it enables students to apply common\nrelational structures of mathematical situations to solve new problems. In this\npaper, we propose to build a novel MWP solver by leveraging analogical MWPs,\nwhich advance the solver's generalization ability across different kinds of\nMWPs. The key idea, named analogy identification, is to associate the\nanalogical MWP pairs in a latent space, i.e., encoding an MWP close to another\nanalogical MWP, while moving away from the non-analogical ones. Moreover, a\nsolution discriminator is integrated into the MWP solver to enhance the\nassociation between the representations of MWPs and their true solutions. The\nevaluation results verify that our proposed analogical learning strategy\npromotes the performance of MWP-BERT on Math23k over the state-of-the-art model\nGenerate2Rank, with 5 times fewer parameters in the encoder. We also find that\nour model has a stronger generalization ability in solving difficult MWPs due\nto the analogical learning from easy MWPs.",
