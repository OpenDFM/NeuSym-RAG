    "abstract": "We introduce doc2dial, a new dataset of goal-oriented dialogues that are\ngrounded in the associated documents. Inspired by how the authors compose\ndocuments for guiding end users, we first construct dialogue flows based on the\ncontent elements that corresponds to higher-level relations across text\nsections as well as lower-level relations between discourse units within a\nsection. Then we present these dialogue flows to crowd contributors to create\nconversational utterances. The dataset includes about 4800 annotated\nconversations with an average of 14 turns that are grounded in over 480\ndocuments from four domains. Compared to the prior document-grounded dialogue\ndatasets, this dataset covers a variety of dialogue scenes in\ninformation-seeking conversations. For evaluating the versatility of the\ndataset, we introduce multiple dialogue modeling tasks and present baseline\napproaches.",
