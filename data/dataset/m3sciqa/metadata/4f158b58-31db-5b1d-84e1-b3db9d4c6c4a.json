    "abstract": "We present BlenderBot 3, a 175B parameter dialogue model capable of\nopen-domain conversation with access to the internet and a long-term memory,\nand having been trained on a large number of user defined tasks. We release\nboth the model weights and code, and have also deployed the model on a public\nweb page to interact with organic users. This technical report describes how\nthe model was built (architecture, model and training scheme), and details of\nits deployment, including safety mechanisms. Human evaluations show its\nsuperiority to existing open-domain dialogue agents, including its predecessors\n(Roller et al., 2021; Komeili et al., 2022). Finally, we detail our plan for\ncontinual learning using the data collected from deployment, which will also be\npublicly released. The goal of this research program is thus to enable the\ncommunity to study ever-improving responsible agents that learn through\ninteraction.",
