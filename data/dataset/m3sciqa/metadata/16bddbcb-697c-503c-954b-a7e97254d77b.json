    "abstract": "We tackle real-world problems with complex structures beyond the pixel-based\ngame or simulator. We formulate it as a few-shot reinforcement learning problem\nwhere a task is characterized by a subtask graph that defines a set of subtasks\nand their dependencies that are unknown to the agent. Different from the\nprevious meta-rl methods trying to directly infer the unstructured task\nembedding, our multi-task subtask graph inferencer (MTSGI) first infers the\ncommon high-level task structure in terms of the subtask graph from the\ntraining tasks, and use it as a prior to improve the task inference in testing.\nOur experiment results on 2D grid-world and complex web navigation domains show\nthat the proposed method can learn and leverage the common underlying structure\nof the tasks for faster adaptation to the unseen tasks than various existing\nalgorithms such as meta reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning, and other heuristic agents.",
