    "abstract": "Translating in real-time, a.k.a. simultaneous translation, outputs\ntranslation words before the input sentence ends, which is a challenging\nproblem for conventional machine translation methods. We propose a neural\nmachine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an\nagent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a\npre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively\nexplore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search\napplicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art\nbaselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\nframework both quantitatively and qualitatively.",
