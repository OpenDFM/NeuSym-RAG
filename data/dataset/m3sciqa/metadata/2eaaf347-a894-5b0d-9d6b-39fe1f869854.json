    "abstract": "Language can be used as a means of reproducing and enforcing harmful\nstereotypes and biases and has been analysed as such in numerous research. In\nthis paper, we present a survey of 304 papers on gender bias in natural\nlanguage processing. We analyse definitions of gender and its categories within\nsocial sciences and connect them to formal definitions of gender bias in NLP\nresearch. We survey lexica and datasets applied in research on gender bias and\nthen compare and contrast approaches to detecting and mitigating gender bias.\nWe find that research on gender bias suffers from four core limitations. 1)\nMost research treats gender as a binary variable neglecting its fluidity and\ncontinuity. 2) Most of the work has been conducted in monolingual setups for\nEnglish or other high-resource languages. 3) Despite a myriad of papers on\ngender bias in NLP methods, we find that most of the newly developed algorithms\ndo not test their models for bias and disregard possible ethical considerations\nof their work. 4) Finally, methodologies developed in this line of research are\nfundamentally flawed covering very limited definitions of gender bias and\nlacking evaluation baselines and pipelines. We suggest recommendations towards\novercoming these limitations as a guide for future research.",
