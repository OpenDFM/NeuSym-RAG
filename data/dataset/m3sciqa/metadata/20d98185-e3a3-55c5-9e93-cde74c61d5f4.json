    "abstract": "We analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive\ntransformer language models, finding evidence that these associations\ncorrespond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a\ncausal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a\nmodel's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in\nmiddle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while\nprocessing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations\ncorrespond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to\nupdate specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We\nfind that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE)\nmodel-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive\nevaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual\nassertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and\ngeneralization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results\nconfirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual\nassociations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms\nmay be a feasible approach for model editing. The code, dataset,\nvisualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available at\nhttps://rome.baulab.info/",
