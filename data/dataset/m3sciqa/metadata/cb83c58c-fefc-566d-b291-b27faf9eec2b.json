    "abstract": "Language models have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks\nthat require natural language understanding. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art\nmodels have generally struggled with tasks that require quantitative reasoning,\nsuch as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college\nlevel. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva, a large language model\npretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical\ncontent. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical\nbenchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on\nover two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry,\neconomics, and other sciences that require quantitative reasoning, and find\nthat the model can correctly answer nearly a third of them.",
