    "abstract": "Recent methods for embodied instruction following are typically trained\nend-to-end using imitation learning. This often requires the use of expert\ntrajectories and low-level language instructions. Such approaches assume that\nneural states will integrate multimodal semantics to perform state tracking,\nbuilding spatial memory, exploration, and long-term planning. In contrast, we\npropose a modular method with structured representations that (1) builds a\nsemantic map of the scene and (2) performs exploration with a semantic search\npolicy, to achieve the natural language goal. Our modular method achieves SOTA\nperformance (24.46 %) with a substantial (8.17 % absolute) gap from previous\nwork while using less data by eschewing both expert trajectories and low-level\ninstructions. Leveraging low-level language, however, can further increase our\nperformance (26.49 %). Our findings suggest that an explicit spatial memory and\na semantic search policy can provide a stronger and more general representation\nfor state-tracking and guidance, even in the absence of expert trajectories or\nlow-level instructions.",
