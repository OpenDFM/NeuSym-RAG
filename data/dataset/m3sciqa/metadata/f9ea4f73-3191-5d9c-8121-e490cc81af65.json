    "abstract": "Fake news detection is a critical yet challenging problem in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). The rapid rise of social networking platforms has not only\nyielded a vast increase in information accessibility but has also accelerated\nthe spread of fake news. Thus, the effect of fake news has been growing,\nsometimes extending to the offline world and threatening public safety. Given\nthe massive amount of Web content, automatic fake news detection is a practical\nNLP problem useful to all online content providers, in order to reduce the\nhuman time and effort to detect and prevent the spread of fake news. In this\npaper, we describe the challenges involved in fake news detection and also\ndescribe related tasks. We systematically review and compare the task\nformulations, datasets and NLP solutions that have been developed for this\ntask, and also discuss the potentials and limitations of them. Based on our\ninsights, we outline promising research directions, including more\nfine-grained, detailed, fair, and practical detection models. We also highlight\nthe difference between fake news detection and other related tasks, and the\nimportance of NLP solutions for fake news detection.",
