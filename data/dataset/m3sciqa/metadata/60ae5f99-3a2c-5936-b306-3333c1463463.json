    "abstract": "Scanned receipts OCR and key information extraction (SROIE) represent the\nprocesseses of recognizing text from scanned receipts and extracting key texts\nfrom them and save the extracted tests to structured documents. SROIE plays\ncritical roles for many document analysis applications and holds great\ncommercial potentials, but very little research works and advances have been\npublished in this area. In recognition of the technical challenges, importance\nand huge commercial potentials of SROIE, we organized the ICDAR 2019\ncompetition on SROIE. In this competition, we set up three tasks, namely,\nScanned Receipt Text Localisation (Task 1), Scanned Receipt OCR (Task 2) and\nKey Information Extraction from Scanned Receipts (Task 3). A new dataset with\n1000 whole scanned receipt images and annotations is created for the\ncompetition. In this report we will presents the motivation, competition\ndatasets, task definition, evaluation protocol, submission statistics,\nperformance of submitted methods and results analysis.",
