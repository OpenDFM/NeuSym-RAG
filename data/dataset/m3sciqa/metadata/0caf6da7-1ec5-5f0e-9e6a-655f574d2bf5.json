    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss the implications of using machine learning for\njudicial decision-making in situations where human rights may be infringed. We\nargue that the use of such tools in these situations should be limited due to\ninherent status quo bias and dangers of reverse-engineering. We discuss that\nthese issues already exist in the judicial systems without using machine\nlearning tools, but how introducing them might exacerbate them.",
