    "abstract": "Transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for\nspoken documents lack structural annotations such as paragraphs, significantly\nreducing their readability. Automatically predicting paragraph segmentation for\nspoken documents may both improve readability and downstream NLP performance\nsuch as summarization and machine reading comprehension. We propose a sequence\nmodel with self-adaptive sliding window for accurate and efficient paragraph\nsegmentation. We also propose an approach to exploit phonetic information,\nwhich significantly improves robustness of spoken document segmentation to ASR\nerrors. Evaluations are conducted on the English Wiki-727K document\nsegmentation benchmark, a Chinese Wikipedia-based document segmentation dataset\nwe created, and an in-house Chinese spoken document dataset. Our proposed model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model based on the same BERT-Base,\nincreasing segmentation F1 on the English benchmark by 4.2 points and on\nChinese datasets by 4.3-10.1 points, while reducing inference time to less than\n1/6 of inference time of the current SOTA.",
