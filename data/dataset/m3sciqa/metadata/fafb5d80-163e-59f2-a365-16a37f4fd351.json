    "abstract": "Ethics regarding social bias has recently thrown striking issues in natural\nlanguage processing. Especially for gender-related topics, the need for a\nsystem that reduces the model bias has grown in areas such as image captioning,\ncontent recommendation, and automated employment. However, detection and\nevaluation of gender bias in the machine translation systems are not yet\nthoroughly investigated, for the task being cross-lingual and challenging to\ndefine. In this paper, we propose a scheme for making up a test set that\nevaluates the gender bias in a machine translation system, with Korean, a\nlanguage with gender-neutral pronouns. Three word/phrase sets are primarily\nconstructed, each incorporating positive/negative expressions or occupations;\nall the terms are gender-independent or at least not biased to one side\nseverely. Then, additional sentence lists are constructed concerning formality\nof the pronouns and politeness of the sentences. With the generated sentence\nset of size 4,236 in total, we evaluate gender bias in conventional machine\ntranslation systems utilizing the proposed measure, which is termed here as\ntranslation gender bias index (TGBI). The corpus and the code for evaluation is\navailable on-line.",
