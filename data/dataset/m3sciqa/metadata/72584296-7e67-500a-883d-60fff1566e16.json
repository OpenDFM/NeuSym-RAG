    "abstract": "Personalized dialogue systems explore the problem of generating responses\nthat are consistent with the user's personality, which has raised much\nattention in recent years. Existing personalized dialogue systems have tried to\nextract user profiles from dialogue history to guide personalized response\ngeneration. Since the dialogue history is usually long and noisy, most existing\nmethods truncate the dialogue history to model the user's personality. Such\nmethods can generate some personalized responses, but a large part of dialogue\nhistory is wasted, leading to sub-optimal performance of personalized response\ngeneration. In this work, we propose to refine the user dialogue history on a\nlarge scale, based on which we can handle more dialogue history and obtain more\nabundant and accurate persona information. Specifically, we design an MSP model\nwhich consists of three personal information refiners and a personalized\nresponse generator. With these multi-level refiners, we can sparsely extract\nthe most valuable information (tokens) from the dialogue history and leverage\nother similar users' data to enhance personalization. Experimental results on\ntwo real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating\nmore informative and personalized responses.",
