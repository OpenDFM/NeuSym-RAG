    "abstract": "Recognizing vulnerability is crucial for understanding and implementing\ntargeted support to empower individuals in need. This is especially important\nat the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), where the court adapts\nConvention standards to meet actual individual needs and thus ensures effective\nhuman rights protection. However, the concept of vulnerability remains elusive\nat the ECtHR and no prior NLP research has dealt with it. To enable future\nresearch in this area, we present VECHR, a novel expert-annotated multi-label\ndataset comprising of vulnerability type classification and explanation\nrationale. We benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art models on VECHR\nfrom both prediction and explainability perspectives. Our results demonstrate\nthe challenging nature of the task with lower prediction performance and\nlimited agreement between models and experts. Further, we analyze the\nrobustness of these models in dealing with out-of-domain (OOD) data and observe\noverall limited performance. Our dataset poses unique challenges offering\nsignificant room for improvement regarding performance, explainability, and\nrobustness.",
