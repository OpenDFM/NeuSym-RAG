    "abstract": "Existing KBQA approaches, despite achieving strong performance on i.i.d. test\ndata, often struggle in generalizing to questions involving unseen KB schema\nitems. Prior ranking-based approaches have shown some success in\ngeneralization, but suffer from the coverage issue. We present RnG-KBQA, a\nRank-and-Generate approach for KBQA, which remedies the coverage issue with a\ngeneration model while preserving a strong generalization capability. Our\napproach first uses a contrastive ranker to rank a set of candidate logical\nforms obtained by searching over the knowledge graph. It then introduces a\ntailored generation model conditioned on the question and the top-ranked\ncandidates to compose the final logical form. We achieve new state-of-the-art\nresults on GrailQA and WebQSP datasets. In particular, our method surpasses the\nprior state-of-the-art by a large margin on the GrailQA leaderboard. In\naddition, RnG-KBQA outperforms all prior approaches on the popular WebQSP\nbenchmark, even including the ones that use the oracle entity linking. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the interplay between\nranking and generation, which leads to the superior performance of our proposed\napproach across all settings with especially strong improvements in zero-shot\ngeneralization.",
