    "abstract": "Geometric Deep Learning has recently attracted significant interest in a wide\nrange of machine learning fields, including document analysis. The application\nof Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has become crucial in various document-related\ntasks since they can unravel important structural patterns, fundamental in key\ninformation extraction processes. Previous works in the literature propose\ntask-driven models and do not take into account the full power of graphs. We\npropose Doc2Graph, a task-agnostic document understanding framework based on a\nGNN model, to solve different tasks given different types of documents. We\nevaluated our approach on two challenging datasets for key information\nextraction in form understanding, invoice layout analysis and table detection.\nOur code is freely accessible on https://github.com/andreagemelli/doc2graph.",
