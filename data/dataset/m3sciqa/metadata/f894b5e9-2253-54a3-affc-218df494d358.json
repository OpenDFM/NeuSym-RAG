    "abstract": "A latent-variable model is introduced for text matching, inferring sentence\nrepresentations by jointly optimizing generative and discriminative objectives.\nTo alleviate typical optimization challenges in latent-variable models for\ntext, we employ deconvolutional networks as the sequence decoder (generator),\nproviding learned latent codes with more semantic information and better\ngeneralization. Our model, trained in an unsupervised manner, yields stronger\nempirical predictive performance than a decoder based on Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM), with less parameters and considerably faster training. Further, we\napply it to text sequence-matching problems. The proposed model significantly\noutperforms several strong sentence-encoding baselines, especially in the\nsemi-supervised setting.",
