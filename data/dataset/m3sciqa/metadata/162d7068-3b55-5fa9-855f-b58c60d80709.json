    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation method, referred to as\nControllable Rewriting based Question Data Augmentation (CRQDA), for machine\nreading comprehension (MRC), question generation, and question-answering\nnatural language inference tasks. We treat the question data augmentation task\nas a constrained question rewriting problem to generate context-relevant,\nhigh-quality, and diverse question data samples. CRQDA utilizes a Transformer\nautoencoder to map the original discrete question into a continuous embedding\nspace. It then uses a pre-trained MRC model to revise the question\nrepresentation iteratively with gradient-based optimization. Finally, the\nrevised question representations are mapped back into the discrete space, which\nserve as additional question data. Comprehensive experiments on SQuAD 2.0,\nSQuAD 1.1 question generation, and QNLI tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCRQDA",
