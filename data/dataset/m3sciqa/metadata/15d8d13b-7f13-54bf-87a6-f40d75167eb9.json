    "abstract": "Curriculum learning (CL) is a training strategy that trains a machine\nlearning model from easier data to harder data, which imitates the meaningful\nlearning order in human curricula. As an easy-to-use plug-in, the CL strategy\nhas demonstrated its power in improving the generalization capacity and\nconvergence rate of various models in a wide range of scenarios such as\ncomputer vision and natural language processing etc. In this survey article, we\ncomprehensively review CL from various aspects including motivations,\ndefinitions, theories, and applications. We discuss works on curriculum\nlearning within a general CL framework, elaborating on how to design a manually\npredefined curriculum or an automatic curriculum. In particular, we summarize\nexisting CL designs based on the general framework of Difficulty\nMeasurer+Training Scheduler and further categorize the methodologies for\nautomatic CL into four groups, i.e., Self-paced Learning, Transfer Teacher, RL\nTeacher, and Other Automatic CL. We also analyze principles to select different\nCL designs that may benefit practical applications. Finally, we present our\ninsights on the relationships connecting CL and other machine learning concepts\nincluding transfer learning, meta-learning, continual learning and active\nlearning, etc., then point out challenges in CL as well as potential future\nresearch directions deserving further investigations.",
