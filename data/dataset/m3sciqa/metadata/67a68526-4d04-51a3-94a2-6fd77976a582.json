    "abstract": "The field of machine learning (ML) has gained widespread adoption, leading to\nsignificant demand for adapting ML to specific scenarios, which is yet\nexpensive and non-trivial. The predominant approaches towards the automation of\nsolving ML tasks (e.g., AutoML) are often time-consuming and hard to understand\nfor human developers. In contrast, though human engineers have the incredible\nability to understand tasks and reason about solutions, their experience and\nknowledge are often sparse and difficult to utilize by quantitative approaches.\nIn this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between machine intelligence and human\nknowledge by introducing a novel framework, which leverages the\nstate-of-the-art large language models to develop ML solutions for novel tasks.\nWe showcase the possibility of extending the capability of LLMs to comprehend\nstructured inputs and perform thorough reasoning for solving novel ML tasks.\nAnd we find that, after some dedicated design, the LLM can (i) observe from the\nexisting experiences of ML tasks and (ii) reason effectively to deliver\npromising results for new tasks. The solution generated can be used directly to\nachieve high levels of competitiveness. Examples and code available at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/CoML.",
