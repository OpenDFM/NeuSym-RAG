    "abstract": "Given a textual passage and an answer, humans are able to ask questions with\nvarious expressions, but this ability is still challenging for most question\ngeneration (QG) systems. Existing solutions mainly focus on the internal\nknowledge within the given passage or the semantic word space for diverse\ncontent planning. These methods, however, have not considered the potential of\nexternal knowledge for expression diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose\nRAST, a framework for Retrieval-Augmented Style Transfer, where the objective\nis to utilize the style of diverse templates for question generation. For\ntraining RAST, we develop a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach\nthat maximizes a weighted combination of diversity reward and consistency\nreward. Here, the consistency reward is computed by a Question-Answering (QA)\nmodel, whereas the diversity reward measures how much the final output mimics\nthe retrieved template. Experimental results show that our method outperforms\nprevious diversity-driven baselines on diversity while being comparable in\nterms of consistency scores. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/gouqi666/RAST.",
