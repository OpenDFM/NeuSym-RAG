    "abstract": "Summarization is the task of compressing source document(s) into coherent and\nsuccinct passages. This is a valuable tool to present users with concise and\naccurate sketch of the top ranked documents related to their queries.\nQuery-based multi-document summarization (qMDS) addresses this pervasive need,\nbut the research is severely limited due to lack of training and evaluation\ndatasets as existing single-document and multi-document summarization datasets\nare inadequate in form and scale. We propose a scalable approach called\nAQuaMuSe to automatically mine qMDS examples from question answering datasets\nand large document corpora. Our approach is unique in the sense that it can\ngeneral a dual dataset -- for extractive and abstractive summaries both. We\npublicly release a specific instance of an AQuaMuSe dataset with 5,519\nquery-based summaries, each associated with an average of 6 input documents\nselected from an index of 355M documents from Common Crawl. Extensive\nevaluation of the dataset along with baseline summarization model experiments\nare provided.",
