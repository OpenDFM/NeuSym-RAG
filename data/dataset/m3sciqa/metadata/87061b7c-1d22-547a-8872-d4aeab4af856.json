    "abstract": "This work introduces a novel task, location-aware visual question generation\n(LocaVQG), which aims to generate engaging questions from data relevant to a\nparticular geographical location. Specifically, we represent such\nlocation-aware information with surrounding images and a GPS coordinate. To\ntackle this task, we present a dataset generation pipeline that leverages GPT-4\nto produce diverse and sophisticated questions. Then, we aim to learn a\nlightweight model that can address the LocaVQG task and fit on an edge device,\nsuch as a mobile phone. To this end, we propose a method which can reliably\ngenerate engaging questions from location-aware information. Our proposed\nmethod outperforms baselines regarding human evaluation (e.g., engagement,\ngrounding, coherence) and automatic evaluation metrics (e.g., BERTScore,\nROUGE-2). Moreover, we conduct extensive ablation studies to justify our\nproposed techniques for both generating the dataset and solving the task.",
