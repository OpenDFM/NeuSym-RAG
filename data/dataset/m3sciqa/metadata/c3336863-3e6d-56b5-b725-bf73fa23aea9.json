    "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained models are able to zero-shot transfer knowledge from\nrich-resource to low-resource languages in machine reading comprehension (MRC).\nHowever, inherent linguistic discrepancies in different languages could make\nanswer spans predicted by zero-shot transfer violate syntactic constraints of\nthe target language. In this paper, we propose a novel multilingual MRC\nframework equipped with a Siamese Semantic Disentanglement Model (SSDM) to\ndisassociate semantics from syntax in representations learned by multilingual\npre-trained models. To explicitly transfer only semantic knowledge to the\ntarget language, we propose two groups of losses tailored for semantic and\nsyntactic encoding and disentanglement. Experimental results on three\nmultilingual MRC datasets (i.e., XQuAD, MLQA, and TyDi QA) demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach over models based on mBERT and XLM-100.\nCode is available at:https://github.com/wulinjuan/SSDM_MRC.",
