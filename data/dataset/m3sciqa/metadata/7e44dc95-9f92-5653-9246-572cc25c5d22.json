    "abstract": "Data-driven analyses of biases in historical texts can help illuminate the\norigin and development of biases prevailing in modern society.\n  However, digitised historical documents pose a challenge for NLP\npractitioners as these corpora suffer from errors introduced by optical\ncharacter recognition (OCR) and are written in an archaic language. In this\npaper, we investigate the continuities and transformations of bias in\nhistorical newspapers published in the Caribbean during the colonial era (18th\nto 19th centuries). Our analyses are performed along the axes of gender, race,\nand their intersection. We examine these biases by conducting a temporal study\nin which we measure the development of lexical associations using\ndistributional semantics models and word embeddings. Further, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of techniques designed to process OCR-generated data and assess\ntheir stability when trained on and applied to the noisy historical newspapers.\nWe find that there is a trade-off between the stability of the word embeddings\nand their compatibility with the historical dataset. We provide evidence that\ngender and racial biases are interdependent, and their intersection triggers\ndistinct effects. These findings align with the theory of intersectionality,\nwhich stresses that biases affecting people with multiple marginalised\nidentities compound to more than the sum of their constituents.",
