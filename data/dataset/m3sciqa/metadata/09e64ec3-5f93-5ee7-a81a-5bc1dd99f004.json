    "abstract": "Concepts play a central role in many applications. This includes settings\nwhere concepts have to be modelled in the absence of sentence context. Previous\nwork has therefore focused on distilling decontextualised concept embeddings\nfrom language models. But concepts can be modelled from different perspectives,\nwhereas concept embeddings typically mostly capture taxonomic structure. To\naddress this issue, we propose a strategy for identifying what different\nconcepts, from a potentially large concept vocabulary, have in common with\nothers. We then represent concepts in terms of the properties they share with\nthe other concepts. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of this way of\nmodelling concepts, we consider the task of ultra-fine entity typing, which is\na challenging multi-label classification problem. We show that by augmenting\nthe label set with shared properties, we can improve the performance of the\nstate-of-the-art models for this task.",
