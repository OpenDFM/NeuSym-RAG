    "abstract": "Propaganda can be defined as a form of communication that aims to influence\nthe opinions or the actions of people towards a specific goal; this is achieved\nby means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Propaganda, in\nthe form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th\ncentury. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media\nthat it has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming\nmajor societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in\nsocial media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in\nmind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of\npropaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus\nof 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can\nappear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows\nthat understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these\ntechniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several\nstate-of-the-art multimodal models.",
