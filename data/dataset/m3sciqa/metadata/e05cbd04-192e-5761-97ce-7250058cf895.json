    "abstract": "The problem of designing NLP solvers for math word problems (MWP) has seen\nsustained research activity and steady gains in the test accuracy. Since\nexisting solvers achieve high performance on the benchmark datasets for\nelementary level MWPs containing one-unknown arithmetic word problems, such\nproblems are often considered \"solved\" with the bulk of research attention\nmoving to more complex MWPs. In this paper, we restrict our attention to\nEnglish MWPs taught in grades four and lower. We provide strong evidence that\nthe existing MWP solvers rely on shallow heuristics to achieve high performance\non the benchmark datasets. To this end, we show that MWP solvers that do not\nhave access to the question asked in the MWP can still solve a large fraction\nof MWPs. Similarly, models that treat MWPs as bag-of-words can also achieve\nsurprisingly high accuracy. Further, we introduce a challenge dataset, SVAMP,\ncreated by applying carefully chosen variations over examples sampled from\nexisting datasets. The best accuracy achieved by state-of-the-art models is\nsubstantially lower on SVAMP, thus showing that much remains to be done even\nfor the simplest of the MWPs.",
