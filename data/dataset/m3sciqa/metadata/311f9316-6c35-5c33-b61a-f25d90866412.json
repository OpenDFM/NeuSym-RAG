    "abstract": "This paper proposes a dually interactive matching network (DIM) for\npresenting the personalities of dialogue agents in retrieval-based chatbots.\nThis model develops from the interactive matching network (IMN) which models\nthe matching degree between a context composed of multiple utterances and a\nresponse candidate. Compared with previous persona fusion approaches which\nenhance the representation of a context by calculating its similarity with a\ngiven persona, the DIM model adopts a dual matching architecture, which\nperforms interactive matching between responses and contexts and between\nresponses and personas respectively for ranking response candidates.\nExperimental results on PERSONA-CHAT dataset show that the DIM model\noutperforms its baseline model, i.e., IMN with persona fusion, by a margin of\n14.5% and outperforms the current state-of-the-art model by a margin of 27.7%\nin terms of top-1 accuracy hits@1.",
