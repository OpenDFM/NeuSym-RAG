    "abstract": "We describe findings of the third Nuanced Arabic Dialect Identification\nShared Task (NADI 2022). NADI aims at advancing state of the art Arabic NLP,\nincluding on Arabic dialects. It does so by affording diverse datasets and\nmodeling opportunities in a standardized context where meaningful comparisons\nbetween models and approaches are possible. NADI 2022 targeted both dialect\nidentification (Subtask 1) and dialectal sentiment analysis (Subtask 2) at the\ncountry level. A total of 41 unique teams registered for the shared task, of\nwhom 21 teams have actually participated (with 105 valid submissions). Among\nthese, 19 teams participated in Subtask 1 and 10 participated in Subtask 2. The\nwinning team achieved 27.06 F1 on Subtask 1 and F1=75.16 on Subtask 2,\nreflecting that the two subtasks remain challenging and motivating future work\nin this area. We describe methods employed by participating teams and offer an\noutlook for NADI.",
