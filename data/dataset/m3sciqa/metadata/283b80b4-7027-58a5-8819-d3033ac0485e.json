    "abstract": "Our goal is a teachable reasoning system for question-answering (QA), where a\nuser can interact with faithful answer explanations, and correct its errors so\nthat the system improves over time. Our approach is to augment a QA model with\na dynamic memory of user feedback, containing user-supplied corrections to\nerroneous model beliefs that users identify during interaction. Retrievals from\nmemory are used as additional context for QA, to help avoid previous mistakes\nin similar new situations - a novel application of memory-based continuous\nlearning. With simulated feedback, we find that our system (called TeachMe)\ncontinually improves with time, and without model retraining, requiring\nfeedback on only 25% of training examples to reach within 1% of the upper-bound\n(feedback on all examples). Similarly, in experiments with real users, we\nobserve a similar trend, with performance improving by over 15% on a hidden\ntest set after teaching. This suggests new opportunities for using frozen\nlanguage models in an interactive setting where users can inspect, debug, and\ncorrect the model's beliefs, leading to improved system's performance over\ntime.",
