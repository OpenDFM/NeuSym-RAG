    "abstract": "We introduce Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR), a task that requires\nproducing structured semantic summaries of images describing: the primary\nactivity, entities engaged in the activity with their roles (e.g. agent, tool),\nand bounding-box groundings of entities. GSR presents important technical\nchallenges: identifying semantic saliency, categorizing and localizing a large\nand diverse set of entities, overcoming semantic sparsity, and disambiguating\nroles. Moreover, unlike in captioning, GSR is straightforward to evaluate. To\nstudy this new task we create the Situations With Groundings (SWiG) dataset\nwhich adds 278,336 bounding-box groundings to the 11,538 entity classes in the\nimsitu dataset. We propose a Joint Situation Localizer and find that jointly\npredicting situations and groundings with end-to-end training handily\noutperforms independent training on the entire grounding metric suite with\nrelative gains between 8% and 32%. Finally, we show initial findings on three\nexciting future directions enabled by our models: conditional querying, visual\nchaining, and grounded semantic aware image retrieval.
