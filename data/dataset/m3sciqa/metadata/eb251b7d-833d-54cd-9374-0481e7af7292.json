    "abstract": "We present the results of the first Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER)\nShared Task. The task challenged participants to classify whether human-written\nfactoid claims could be Supported or Refuted using evidence retrieved from\nWikipedia. We received entries from 23 competing teams, 19 of which scored\nhigher than the previously published baseline. The best performing system\nachieved a FEVER score of 64.21%. In this paper, we present the results of the\nshared task and a summary of the systems, highlighting commonalities and\ninnovations among participating systems.",
