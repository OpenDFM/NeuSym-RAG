    "abstract": "Open-domain Question Answering (OpenQA) is an important task in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), which aims to answer a question in the form of\nnatural language based on large-scale unstructured documents. Recently, there\nhas been a surge in the amount of research literature on OpenQA, particularly\non techniques that integrate with neural Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC).\nWhile these research works have advanced performance to new heights on\nbenchmark datasets, they have been rarely covered in existing surveys on QA\nsystems. In this work, we review the latest research trends in OpenQA, with\nparticular attention to systems that incorporate neural MRC techniques.\nSpecifically, we begin with revisiting the origin and development of OpenQA\nsystems. We then introduce modern OpenQA architecture named \"Retriever-Reader\"\nand analyze the various systems that follow this architecture as well as the\nspecific techniques adopted in each of the components. We then discuss key\nchallenges to developing OpenQA systems and offer an analysis of benchmarks\nthat are commonly used. We hope our work would enable researchers to be\ninformed of the recent advancement and also the open challenges in OpenQA\nresearch, so as to stimulate further progress in this field.",
