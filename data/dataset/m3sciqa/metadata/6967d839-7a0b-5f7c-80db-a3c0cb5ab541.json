    "abstract": "To solve Math Word Problems, human students leverage diverse reasoning logic\nthat reaches different possible equation solutions. However, the mainstream\nsequence-to-sequence approach of automatic solvers aims to decode a fixed\nsolution equation supervised by human annotation. In this paper, we propose a\ncontrolled equation generation solver by leveraging a set of control codes to\nguide the model to consider certain reasoning logic and decode the\ncorresponding equations expressions transformed from the human reference. The\nempirical results suggest that our method universally improves the performance\non single-unknown (Math23K) and multiple-unknown (DRAW1K, HMWP) benchmarks,\nwith substantial improvements up to 13.2% accuracy on the challenging\nmultiple-unknown datasets.",
