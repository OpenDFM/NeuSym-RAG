    "abstract": "Building conversational systems in new domains and with added functionality\nrequires resource-efficient models that work under low-data regimes (i.e., in\nfew-shot setups). Motivated by these requirements, we introduce intent\ndetection methods backed by pretrained dual sentence encoders such as USE and\nConveRT. We demonstrate the usefulness and wide applicability of the proposed\nintent detectors, showing that: 1) they outperform intent detectors based on\nfine-tuning the full BERT-Large model or using BERT as a fixed black-box\nencoder on three diverse intent detection data sets; 2) the gains are\nespecially pronounced in few-shot setups (i.e., with only 10 or 30 annotated\nexamples per intent); 3) our intent detectors can be trained in a matter of\nminutes on a single CPU; and 4) they are stable across different hyperparameter\nsettings. In hope of facilitating and democratizing research focused on\nintention detection, we release our code, as well as a new challenging\nsingle-domain intent detection dataset comprising 13,083 annotated examples\nover 77 intents.",
