    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue generation is challenging since the underlying\nknowledge is often dynamic and effectively incorporating knowledge into the\nlearning process is hard. It is particularly challenging to generate both\nhuman-like and informative responses in this setting. Recent research primarily\nfocused on various knowledge distillation methods where the underlying\nrelationship between the facts in a knowledge base is not effectively captured.\nIn this paper, we go one step further and demonstrate how the structural\ninformation of a knowledge graph can improve the system's inference\ncapabilities. Specifically, we propose DialoKG, a novel task-oriented dialogue\nsystem that effectively incorporates knowledge into a language model. Our\nproposed system views relational knowledge as a knowledge graph and introduces\n(1) a structure-aware knowledge embedding technique, and (2) a knowledge\ngraph-weighted attention masking strategy to facilitate the system selecting\nrelevant information during the dialogue generation. An empirical evaluation\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of DialoKG over state-of-the-art methods on\nseveral standard benchmark datasets.",
