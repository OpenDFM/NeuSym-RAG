    "abstract": "Despite decades of efforts, robot navigation in a real scenario with\nvolatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA for short), remains a\nchallenging topic. Inspired by the central nervous system (CNS), we propose a\nhierarchical multi-expert learning framework for autonomous navigation in a\nVUCA environment. With a heuristic exploration mechanism considering target\nlocation, path cost, and safety level, the upper layer performs simultaneous\nmap exploration and route-planning to avoid trapping in a blind alley, similar\nto the cerebrum in the CNS. Using a local adaptive model fusing multiple\ndiscrepant strategies, the lower layer pursuits a balance between\ncollision-avoidance and go-straight strategies, acting as the cerebellum in the\nCNS. We conduct simulation and real-world experiments on multiple platforms,\nincluding legged and wheeled robots. Experimental results demonstrate our\nalgorithm outperforms the existing methods in terms of task achievement, time\nefficiency, and security.",
