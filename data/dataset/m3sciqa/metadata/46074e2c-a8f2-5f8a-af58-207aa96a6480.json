    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of knowledge-intensive text-to-SQL, in\nwhich domain knowledge is necessary to parse expert questions into SQL queries\nover domain-specific tables. We formalize this scenario by building a new\nChinese benchmark KnowSQL consisting of domain-specific questions covering\nvarious domains. We then address this problem by presenting formulaic\nknowledge, rather than by annotating additional data examples. More concretely,\nwe construct a formulaic knowledge bank as a domain knowledge base and propose\na framework (ReGrouP) to leverage this formulaic knowledge during parsing.\nExperiments using ReGrouP demonstrate a significant 28.2% improvement overall\non KnowSQL.",
