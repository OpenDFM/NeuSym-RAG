    "abstract": "Multi-document grounded dialogue systems (DGDS) belong to a class of\nconversational agents that answer users' requests by finding supporting\nknowledge from a collection of documents. Most previous studies aim to improve\nthe knowledge retrieval model or propose more effective ways to incorporate\nexternal knowledge into a parametric generation model. These methods, however,\nfocus on retrieving knowledge from mono-granularity language units (e.g.\npassages, sentences, or spans in documents), which is not enough to effectively\nand efficiently capture precise knowledge in long documents. This paper\nproposes Re3G, which aims to optimize both coarse-grained knowledge retrieval\nand fine-grained knowledge extraction in a unified framework. Specifically, the\nformer efficiently finds relevant passages in a retrieval-and-reranking\nprocess, whereas the latter effectively extracts finer-grain spans within those\npassages to incorporate into a parametric answer generation model (BART, T5).\nExperiments on DialDoc Shared Task demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",
