    "abstract": "The rapid improvement of language models has raised the specter of abuse of\ntext generation systems. This progress motivates the development of simple\nmethods for detecting generated text that can be used by and explained to\nnon-experts. We develop GLTR, a tool to support humans in detecting whether a\ntext was generated by a model. GLTR applies a suite of baseline statistical\nmethods that can detect generation artifacts across common sampling schemes. In\na human-subjects study, we show that the annotation scheme provided by GLTR\nimproves the human detection-rate of fake text from 54% to 72% without any\nprior training. GLTR is open-source and publicly deployed, and has already been\nwidely used to detect generated outputs",
