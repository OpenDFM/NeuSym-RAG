    "abstract": "In this work, we explore whether the recently demonstrated zero-shot\nabilities of the T0 model extend to Named Entity Recognition for\nout-of-distribution languages and time periods. Using a historical newspaper\ncorpus in 3 languages as test-bed, we use prompts to extract possible named\nentities. Our results show that a naive approach for prompt-based zero-shot\nmultilingual Named Entity Recognition is error-prone, but highlights the\npotential of such an approach for historical languages lacking labeled\ndatasets. Moreover, we also find that T0-like models can be probed to predict\nthe publication date and language of a document, which could be very relevant\nfor the study of historical texts.",
