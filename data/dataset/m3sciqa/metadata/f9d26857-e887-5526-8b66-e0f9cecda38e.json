    "abstract": "As offensive content has become pervasive in social media, there has been\nmuch research in identifying potentially offensive messages. However, previous\nwork on this topic did not consider the problem as a whole, but rather focused\non detecting very specific types of offensive content, e.g., hate speech,\ncyberbulling, or cyber-aggression. In contrast, here we target several\ndifferent kinds of offensive content. In particular, we model the task\nhierarchically, identifying the type and the target of offensive messages in\nsocial media. For this purpose, we complied the Offensive Language\nIdentification Dataset (OLID), a new dataset with tweets annotated for\noffensive content using a fine-grained three-layer annotation scheme, which we\nmake publicly available. We discuss the main similarities and differences\nbetween OLID and pre-existing datasets for hate speech identification,\naggression detection, and similar tasks. We further experiment with and we\ncompare the performance of different machine learning models on OLID.",
