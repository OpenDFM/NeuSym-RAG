    "abstract": "Recently, Locate-Then-Edit paradigm has emerged as one of the main approaches\nin changing factual knowledge stored in the Language models. However, there is\na lack of research on whether present locating methods can pinpoint the exact\nparameters embedding the desired knowledge. Moreover, although many researchers\nhave questioned the validity of locality hypothesis of factual knowledge, no\nmethod is provided to test the a hypothesis for more in-depth discussion and\nresearch. Therefore, we introduce KLoB, a benchmark examining three essential\nproperties that a reliable knowledge locating method should satisfy. KLoB can\nserve as a benchmark for evaluating existing locating methods in language\nmodels, and can contributes a method to reassessing the validity of locality\nhypothesis of factual knowledge. KLoB is publicly available at an anonymous\nGitHub: \\url{https://github.com/anon6662/KLoB}.",
