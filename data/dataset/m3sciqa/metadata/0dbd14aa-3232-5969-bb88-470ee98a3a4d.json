    "abstract": "Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) achieves significant\ndecoding speedup through generating target words independently and\nsimultaneously. However, in the context of non-autoregressive translation, the\nword-level cross-entropy loss cannot model the target-side sequential\ndependency properly, leading to its weak correlation with the translation\nquality. As a result, NAT tends to generate influent translations with\nover-translation and under-translation errors. In this paper, we propose to\ntrain NAT to minimize the Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model\noutput and the reference sentence. The bag-of-ngrams training objective is\ndifferentiable and can be efficiently calculated, which encourages NAT to\ncapture the target-side sequential dependency and correlates well with the\ntranslation quality. We validate our approach on three translation tasks and\nshow that our approach largely outperforms the NAT baseline by about 5.0 BLEU\nscores on WMT14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De and about 2.5 BLEU scores on WMT16\nEn$\\leftrightarrow$Ro.",
