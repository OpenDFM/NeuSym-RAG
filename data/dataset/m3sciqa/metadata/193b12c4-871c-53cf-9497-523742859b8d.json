    "abstract": "We introduce Dessurt, a relatively simple document understanding transformer\ncapable of being fine-tuned on a greater variety of document tasks than prior\nmethods. It receives a document image and task string as input and generates\narbitrary text autoregressively as output. Because Dessurt is an end-to-end\narchitecture that performs text recognition in addition to the document\nunderstanding, it does not require an external recognition model as prior\nmethods do. Dessurt is a more flexible model than prior methods and is able to\nhandle a variety of document domains and tasks. We show that this model is\neffective at 9 different dataset-task combinations.",
