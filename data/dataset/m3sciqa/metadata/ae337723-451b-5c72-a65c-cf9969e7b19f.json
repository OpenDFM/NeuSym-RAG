    "abstract": "As the interaction over the web has increased, incidents of aggression and\nrelated events like trolling, cyberbullying, flaming, hate speech, etc. too\nhave increased manifold across the globe. While most of these behaviour like\nbullying or hate speech have predated the Internet, the reach and extent of the\nInternet has given these an unprecedented power and influence to affect the\nlives of billions of people. So it is of utmost significance and importance\nthat some preventive measures be taken to provide safeguard to the people using\nthe web such that the web remains a viable medium of communication and\nconnection, in general. In this paper, we discuss the development of an\naggression tagset and an annotated corpus of Hindi-English code-mixed data from\ntwo of the most popular social networking and social media platforms in India,\nTwitter and Facebook. The corpus is annotated using a hierarchical tagset of 3\ntop-level tags and 10 level 2 tags. The final dataset contains approximately\n18k tweets and 21k facebook comments and is being released for further research\nin the field.",
