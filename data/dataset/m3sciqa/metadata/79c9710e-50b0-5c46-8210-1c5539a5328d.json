    "abstract": "Existing approaches for named entity recognition suffer from data sparsity\nproblems when conducted on short and informal texts, especially user-generated\nsocial media content. Semantic augmentation is a potential way to alleviate\nthis problem. Given that rich semantic information is implicitly preserved in\npre-trained word embeddings, they are potential ideal resources for semantic\naugmentation. In this paper, we propose a neural-based approach to NER for\nsocial media texts where both local (from running text) and augmented semantics\nare taken into account. In particular, we obtain the augmented semantic\ninformation from a large-scale corpus, and propose an attentive semantic\naugmentation module and a gate module to encode and aggregate such information,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets\ncollected from English and Chinese social media platforms, where the results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our approach to previous studies across all\nthree datasets.",
