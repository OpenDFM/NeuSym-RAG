    "abstract": "Legal judgment prediction is the task of automatically predicting the outcome\nof a court case, given a text describing the case's facts. Previous work on\nusing neural models for this task has focused on Chinese; only feature-based\nmodels (e.g., using bags of words and topics) have been considered in English.\nWe release a new English legal judgment prediction dataset, containing cases\nfrom the European Court of Human Rights. We evaluate a broad variety of neural\nmodels on the new dataset, establishing strong baselines that surpass previous\nfeature-based models in three tasks: (1) binary violation classification; (2)\nmulti-label classification; (3) case importance prediction. We also explore if\nmodels are biased towards demographic information via data anonymization. As a\nside-product, we propose a hierarchical version of BERT, which bypasses BERT's\nlength limitation.",
