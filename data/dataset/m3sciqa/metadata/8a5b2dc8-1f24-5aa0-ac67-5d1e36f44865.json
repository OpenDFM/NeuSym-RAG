    "abstract": "We investigate the potential of attention-based neural machine translation in\nsimultaneous translation. We introduce a novel decoding algorithm, called\nsimultaneous greedy decoding, that allows an existing neural machine\ntranslation model to begin translating before a full source sentence is\nreceived. This approach is unique from previous works on simultaneous\ntranslation in that segmentation and translation are done jointly to maximize\nthe translation quality and that translating each segment is strongly\nconditioned on all the previous segments. This paper presents a first step\ntoward building a full simultaneous translation system based on neural machine\ntranslation.",
