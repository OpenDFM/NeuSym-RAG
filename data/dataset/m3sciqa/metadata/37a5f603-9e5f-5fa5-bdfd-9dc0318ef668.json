    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialog systems need to know when a query falls outside their\nrange of supported intents, but current text classification corpora only define\nlabel sets that cover every example. We introduce a new dataset that includes\nqueries that are out-of-scope---i.e., queries that do not fall into any of the\nsystem's supported intents. This poses a new challenge because models cannot\nassume that every query at inference time belongs to a system-supported intent\nclass. Our dataset also covers 150 intent classes over 10 domains, capturing\nthe breadth that a production task-oriented agent must handle. We evaluate a\nrange of benchmark classifiers on our dataset along with several different\nout-of-scope identification schemes. We find that while the classifiers perform\nwell on in-scope intent classification, they struggle to identify out-of-scope\nqueries. Our dataset and evaluation fill an important gap in the field,\noffering a way of more rigorously and realistically benchmarking text\nclassification in task-driven dialog systems.",
