    "abstract": "Given a document and a target aspect (e.g., a topic of interest),\naspect-based abstractive summarization attempts to generate a summary with\nrespect to the aspect. Previous studies usually assume a small pre-defined set\nof aspects and fall short of summarizing on other diverse topics. In this work,\nwe study summarizing on arbitrary aspects relevant to the document, which\nsignificantly expands the application of the task in practice. Due to the lack\nof supervision data, we develop a new weak supervision construction method and\nan aspect modeling scheme, both of which integrate rich external knowledge\nsources such as ConceptNet and Wikipedia. Experiments show our approach\nachieves performance boosts on summarizing both real and synthetic documents\ngiven pre-defined or arbitrary aspects.",
