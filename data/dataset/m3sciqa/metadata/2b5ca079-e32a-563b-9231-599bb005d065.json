    "abstract": "Representation learning of graph-structured data is challenging because both\ngraph structure and node features carry important information. Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network\nstructure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks.\nHere we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic\nprinciple that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned\nrepresentation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general\nInformation Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient\nrepresentation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between\nthe representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual\ninformation between the representation and the input data. Different from the\ngeneral IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information.\nWe design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate\nthe GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate\nthe benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that\nour proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models.\nGIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31% improvement with adversarial\nperturbation of the graph structure as well as node features.",
