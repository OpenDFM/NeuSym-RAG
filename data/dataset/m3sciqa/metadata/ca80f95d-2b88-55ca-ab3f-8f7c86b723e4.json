    "abstract": "A vast amount of location information exists in unstructured texts, such as\nsocial media posts, news stories, scientific articles, web pages, travel blogs,\nand historical archives. Geoparsing refers to the process of recognizing\nlocation references from texts and identifying their geospatial\nrepresentations. While geoparsing can benefit many domains, a summary of the\nspecific applications is still missing. Further, there lacks a comprehensive\nreview and comparison of existing approaches for location reference\nrecognition, which is the first and a core step of geoparsing. To fill these\nresearch gaps, this review first summarizes seven typical application domains\nof geoparsing: geographic information retrieval, disaster management, disease\nsurveillance, traffic management, spatial humanities, tourism management, and\ncrime management. We then review existing approaches for location reference\nrecognition by categorizing these approaches into four groups based on their\nunderlying functional principle: rule-based, gazetteer matching-based,\nstatistical learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Next, we thoroughly evaluate\nthe correctness and computational efficiency of the 27 most widely used\napproaches for location reference recognition based on 26 public datasets with\ndifferent types of texts (e.g., social media posts and news stories) containing\n39,736 location references across the world. Results from this thorough\nevaluation can help inform future methodological developments for location\nreference recognition, and can help guide the selection of proper approaches\nbased on application needs.",
