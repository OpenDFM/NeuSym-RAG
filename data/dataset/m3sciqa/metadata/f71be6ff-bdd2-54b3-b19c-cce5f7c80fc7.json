    "abstract": "This paper describes the fifth year of the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter\ntask. SemEval-2017 Task 4 continues with a rerun of the subtasks of\nSemEval-2016 Task 4, which include identifying the overall sentiment of the\ntweet, sentiment towards a topic with classification on a two-point and on a\nfive-point ordinal scale, and quantification of the distribution of sentiment\ntowards a topic across a number of tweets: again on a two-point and on a\nfive-point ordinal scale. Compared to 2016, we made two changes: (i) we\nintroduced a new language, Arabic, for all subtasks, and (ii)~we made available\ninformation from the profiles of the Twitter users who posted the target\ntweets. The task continues to be very popular, with a total of 48 teams\nparticipating this year.",
