    "abstract": "Recent work on opinion summarization produces general summaries based on a\nset of input reviews and the popularity of opinions expressed in them. In this\npaper, we propose an approach that allows the generation of customized\nsummaries based on aspect queries (e.g., describing the location and room of a\nhotel). Using a review corpus, we create a synthetic training dataset of\n(review, summary) pairs enriched with aspect controllers which are induced by a\nmulti-instance learning model that predicts the aspects of a document at\ndifferent levels of granularity. We fine-tune a pretrained model using our\nsynthetic dataset and generate aspect-specific summaries by modifying the\naspect controllers. Experiments on two benchmarks show that our model\noutperforms the previous state of the art and generates personalized summaries\nby controlling the number of aspects discussed in them.",
