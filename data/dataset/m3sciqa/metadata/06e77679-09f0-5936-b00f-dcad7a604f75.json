    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like reasoning abilities but\nstill struggle with complex logical problems. This paper introduces a novel\nframework, Logic-LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve\nlogical problem-solving. Our method first utilizes LLMs to translate a natural\nlanguage problem into a symbolic formulation. Afterward, a deterministic\nsymbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem. We also introduce\na self-refinement module, which utilizes the symbolic solver's error messages\nto revise symbolic formalizations. We demonstrate Logic-LM's effectiveness on\nfive logical reasoning datasets: ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, FOLIO,\nLogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT. On average, Logic-LM achieves a significant\nperformance boost of 39.2% over using LLM alone with standard prompting and\n18.4% over LLM with chain-of-thought prompting. Our findings suggest that\nLogic-LM, by combining LLMs with symbolic logic, offers a promising avenue for\nfaithful logical reasoning.
