    "abstract": "This work aims to tackle the challenging heterogeneous graph encoding problem\nin the text-to-SQL task. Previous methods are typically node-centric and merely\nutilize different weight matrices to parameterize edge types, which 1) ignore\nthe rich semantics embedded in the topological structure of edges, and 2) fail\nto distinguish local and non-local relations for each node. To this end, we\npropose a Line Graph Enhanced Text-to-SQL (LGESQL) model to mine the underlying\nrelational features without constructing meta-paths. By virtue of the line\ngraph, messages propagate more efficiently through not only connections between\nnodes, but also the topology of directed edges. Furthermore, both local and\nnon-local relations are integrated distinctively during the graph iteration. We\nalso design an auxiliary task called graph pruning to improve the\ndiscriminative capability of the encoder. Our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results (62.8% with Glove, 72.0% with Electra) on the\ncross-domain text-to-SQL benchmark Spider at the time of writing.",
