    "abstract": "BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new\nstate-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic\ntextual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into\nthe network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most\nsimilar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million\ninference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it\nunsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks\nlike clustering.\n  In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the\npretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to\nderive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using\ncosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair\nfrom 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while\nmaintaining the accuracy from BERT.\n  We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning\ntasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.",
