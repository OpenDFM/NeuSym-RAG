    "abstract": "Rapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between human and AI-generated texts, which may lead to undesirable\nconsequences for society. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to study\nthe properties of human texts that are invariant over different text domains\nand varying proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any\nlanguage, and can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless\nof the generation model and sampling method. In this work, we propose such an\ninvariant for human-written texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the\nmanifold underlying the set of embeddings for a given text sample. We show that\nthe average intrinsic dimensionality of fluent texts in a natural language is\nhovering around the value $9$ for several alphabet-based languages and around\n$7$ for Chinese, while the average intrinsic dimensionality of AI-generated\ntexts for each language is $\\approx 1.5$ lower, with a clear statistical\nseparation between human-generated and AI-generated distributions. This\nproperty allows us to build a score-based artificial text detector. The\nproposed detector's accuracy is stable over text domains, generator models, and\nhuman writer proficiency levels, outperforming SOTA detectors in model-agnostic\nand cross-domain scenarios by a significant margin.",
