    "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) has a significant impact on society via\ntechnologies such as machine translation and search engines. Despite its\nsuccess, NLP technology is only widely available for high-resource languages\nsuch as English and Chinese, while it remains inaccessible to many languages\ndue to the unavailability of data resources and benchmarks. In this work, we\nfocus on developing resources for languages in Indonesia. Despite being the\nsecond most linguistically diverse country, most languages in Indonesia are\ncategorized as endangered and some are even extinct. We develop the first-ever\nparallel resource for 10 low-resource languages in Indonesia. Our resource\nincludes datasets, a multi-task benchmark, and lexicons, as well as a parallel\nIndonesian-English dataset. We provide extensive analyses and describe the\nchallenges when creating such resources. We hope that our work can spark NLP\nresearch on Indonesian and other underrepresented languages.",
