    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the presence of occupational gender stereotypes\nin sentiment analysis models. Such a task has implications for reducing\nimplicit biases in these models, which are being applied to an increasingly\nwide variety of downstream tasks. We release a new gender-balanced dataset of\n800 sentences pertaining to specific professions and propose a methodology for\nusing it as a test bench to evaluate sentiment analysis models. We evaluate the\npresence of occupational gender stereotypes in 3 different models using our\napproach, and explore their relationship with societal perceptions of\noccupations.",
