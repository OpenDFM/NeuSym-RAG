    "abstract": "Formal query building is an important part of complex question answering over\nknowledge bases. It aims to build correct executable queries for questions.\nRecent methods try to rank candidate queries generated by a state-transition\nstrategy. However, this candidate generation strategy ignores the structure of\nqueries, resulting in a considerable number of noisy queries. In this paper, we\npropose a new formal query building approach that consists of two stages. In\nthe first stage, we predict the query structure of the question and leverage\nthe structure to constrain the generation of the candidate queries. We propose\na novel graph generation framework to handle the structure prediction task and\ndesign an encoder-decoder model to predict the argument of the predetermined\noperation in each generative step. In the second stage, we follow the previous\nmethods to rank the candidate queries. The experimental results show that our\nformal query building approach outperforms existing methods on complex\nquestions while staying competitive on simple questions.",
