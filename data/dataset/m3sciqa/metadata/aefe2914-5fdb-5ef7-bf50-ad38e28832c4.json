    "abstract": "In various natural language processing tasks, passage retrieval and passage\nre-ranking are two key procedures in finding and ranking relevant information.\nSince both the two procedures contribute to the final performance, it is\nimportant to jointly optimize them in order to achieve mutual improvement. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel joint training approach for dense passage\nretrieval and passage re-ranking. A major contribution is that we introduce the\ndynamic listwise distillation, where we design a unified listwise training\napproach for both the retriever and the re-ranker. During the dynamic\ndistillation, the retriever and the re-ranker can be adaptively improved\naccording to each other's relevance information. We also propose a hybrid data\naugmentation strategy to construct diverse training instances for listwise\ntraining approach. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach\non both MSMARCO and Natural Questions datasets. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/RocketQA.",
