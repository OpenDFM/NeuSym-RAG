    "abstract": "Variational inference relies on flexible approximate posterior distributions.\nNormalizing flows provide a general recipe to construct flexible variational\nposteriors. We introduce Sylvester normalizing flows, which can be seen as a\ngeneralization of planar flows. Sylvester normalizing flows remove the\nwell-known single-unit bottleneck from planar flows, making a single\ntransformation much more flexible. We compare the performance of Sylvester\nnormalizing flows against planar flows and inverse autoregressive flows and\ndemonstrate that they compare favorably on several datasets.",
