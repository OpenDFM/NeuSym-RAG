    "abstract": "We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2020 Task 11 on\nDetection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles. The task featured two\nsubtasks. Subtask SI is about Span Identification: given a plain-text document,\nspot the specific text fragments containing propaganda. Subtask TC is about\nTechnique Classification: given a specific text fragment, in the context of a\nfull document, determine the propaganda technique it uses, choosing from an\ninventory of 14 possible propaganda techniques. The task attracted a large\nnumber of participants: 250 teams signed up to participate and 44 made a\nsubmission on the test set. In this paper, we present the task, analyze the\nresults, and discuss the system submissions and the methods they used. For both\nsubtasks, the best systems used pre-trained Transformers and ensembles.",
