    "abstract": "We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity\ndisambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components\nare entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows,\nand a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach\nthereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches\nsuch as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive\nexperiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or state-of-the-art\naccuracy at moderate computational costs.",
