    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently been shown to generate high-quality synthetic\nimages, especially when paired with a guidance technique to trade off diversity\nfor fidelity. We explore diffusion models for the problem of text-conditional\nimage synthesis and compare two different guidance strategies: CLIP guidance\nand classifier-free guidance. We find that the latter is preferred by human\nevaluators for both photorealism and caption similarity, and often produces\nphotorealistic samples. Samples from a 3.5 billion parameter text-conditional\ndiffusion model using classifier-free guidance are favored by human evaluators\nto those from DALL-E, even when the latter uses expensive CLIP reranking.\nAdditionally, we find that our models can be fine-tuned to perform image\ninpainting, enabling powerful text-driven image editing. We train a smaller\nmodel on a filtered dataset and release the code and weights at\nhttps://github.com/openai/glide-text2im.",
