    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) is known to be helpful for the task of question\nanswering (QA), since it provides well-structured relational information\nbetween entities, and allows one to further infer indirect facts. However, it\nis challenging to build QA systems which can learn to reason over knowledge\ngraphs based on question-answer pairs alone. First, when people ask questions,\ntheir expressions are noisy (for example, typos in texts, or variations in\npronunciations), which is non-trivial for the QA system to match those\nmentioned entities to the knowledge graph. Second, many questions require\nmulti-hop logic reasoning over the knowledge graph to retrieve the answers. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel and unified deep learning\narchitecture, and an end-to-end variational learning algorithm which can handle\nnoise in questions, and learn multi-hop reasoning simultaneously. Our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on a recent benchmark dataset in the\nliterature. We also derive a series of new benchmark datasets, including\nquestions for multi-hop reasoning, questions paraphrased by neural translation\nmodel, and questions in human voice. Our method yields very promising results\non all these challenging datasets.",
