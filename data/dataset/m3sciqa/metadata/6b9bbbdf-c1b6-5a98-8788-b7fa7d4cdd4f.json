    "abstract": "Aspect-based summarization is the task of generating focused summaries based\non specific points of interest. Such summaries aid efficient analysis of text,\nsuch as quickly understanding reviews or opinions from different angles.\nHowever, due to large differences in the type of aspects for different domains\n(e.g., sentiment, product features), the development of previous models has\ntended to be domain-specific. In this paper, we propose WikiAsp, a large-scale\ndataset for multi-domain aspect-based summarization that attempts to spur\nresearch in the direction of open-domain aspect-based summarization.\nSpecifically, we build the dataset using Wikipedia articles from 20 different\ndomains, using the section titles and boundaries of each article as a proxy for\naspect annotation. We propose several straightforward baseline models for this\ntask and conduct experiments on the dataset. Results highlight key challenges\nthat existing summarization models face in this setting, such as proper pronoun\nhandling of quoted sources and consistent explanation of time-sensitive events.",
