    "abstract": "Mixed initiative in open-domain dialogue requires a system to pro-actively\nintroduce new topics. The one-turn topic transition task explores how a system\nconnects two topics in a cooperative and coherent manner. The goal of the task\nis to generate a \"bridging\" utterance connecting the new topic to the topic of\nthe previous conversation turn. We are especially interested in commonsense\nexplanations of how a new topic relates to what has been mentioned before. We\nfirst collect a new dataset of human one-turn topic transitions, which we call\nOTTers. We then explore different strategies used by humans when asked to\ncomplete such a task, and notice that the use of a bridging utterance to\nconnect the two topics is the approach used the most. We finally show how\nexisting state-of-the-art text generation models can be adapted to this task\nand examine the performance of these baselines on different splits of the\nOTTers data.",
