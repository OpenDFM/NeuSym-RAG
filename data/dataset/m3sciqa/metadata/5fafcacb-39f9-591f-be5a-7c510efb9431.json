    "abstract": "Automatic response forecasting for news media plays a crucial role in\nenabling content producers to efficiently predict the impact of news releases\nand prevent unexpected negative outcomes such as social conflict and moral\ninjury. To effectively forecast responses, it is essential to develop measures\nthat leverage the social dynamics and contextual information surrounding\nindividuals, especially in cases where explicit profiles or historical actions\nof the users are limited (referred to as lurkers). As shown in a previous\nstudy, 97% of all tweets are produced by only the most active 25% of users.\nHowever, existing approaches have limited exploration of how to best process\nand utilize these important features. To address this gap, we propose a novel\nframework, named SocialSense, that leverages a large language model to induce a\nbelief-centered graph on top of an existent social network, along with\ngraph-based propagation to capture social dynamics. We hypothesize that the\ninduced graph that bridges the gap between distant users who share similar\nbeliefs allows the model to effectively capture the response patterns. Our\nmethod surpasses existing state-of-the-art in experimental evaluations for both\nzero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in response\nforecasting. Moreover, the analysis reveals the framework's capability to\neffectively handle unseen user and lurker scenarios, further highlighting its\nrobustness and practical applicability.",
