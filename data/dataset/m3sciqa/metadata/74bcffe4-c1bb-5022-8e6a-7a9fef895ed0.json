    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliable and safe\ndeployment of machine learning systems in the real world. Great progress has\nbeen made over the past years. This paper presents the first review of recent\nadvances in OOD detection with a particular focus on natural language\nprocessing approaches. First, we provide a formal definition of OOD detection\nand discuss several related fields. We then categorize recent algorithms into\nthree classes according to the data they used: (1) OOD data available, (2) OOD\ndata unavailable + in-distribution (ID) label available, and (3) OOD data\nunavailable + ID label unavailable. Third, we introduce datasets, applications,\nand metrics. Finally, we summarize existing work and present potential future\nresearch topics.",
