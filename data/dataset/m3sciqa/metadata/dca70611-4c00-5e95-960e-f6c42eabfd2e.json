    "abstract": "Few-Shot Sequence Labeling (FSSL) is a canonical paradigm for the tagging\nmodels, e.g., named entity recognition and slot filling, to generalize on an\nemerging, resource-scarce domain. Recently, the metric-based meta-learning\nframework has been recognized as a promising approach for FSSL. However, most\nprior works assign a label to each token based on the token-level similarities,\nwhich ignores the integrality of named entities or slots. To this end, in this\npaper, we propose ESD, an Enhanced Span-based Decomposition method for FSSL.\nESD formulates FSSL as a span-level matching problem between test query and\nsupporting instances. Specifically, ESD decomposes the span matching problem\ninto a series of span-level procedures, mainly including enhanced span\nrepresentation, class prototype aggregation and span conflicts resolution.\nExtensive experiments show that ESD achieves the new state-of-the-art results\non two popular FSSL benchmarks, FewNERD and SNIPS, and is proven to be more\nrobust in the nested and noisy tagging scenarios.
