    "abstract": "We introduce a pair of tools, Rasa NLU and Rasa Core, which are open source\npython libraries for building conversational software. Their purpose is to make\nmachine-learning based dialogue management and language understanding\naccessible to non-specialist software developers. In terms of design\nphilosophy, we aim for ease of use, and bootstrapping from minimal (or no)\ninitial training data. Both packages are extensively documented and ship with a\ncomprehensive suite of tests. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/RasaHQ/",
