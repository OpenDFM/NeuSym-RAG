    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations\ninto continuous vector spaces, is gaining increasing attention. Previous\nmethods allow a single static embedding for each entity or relation, ignoring\ntheir intrinsic contextual nature, i.e., entities and relations may appear in\ndifferent graph contexts, and accordingly, exhibit different properties. This\nwork presents Contextualized Knowledge Graph Embedding (CoKE), a novel paradigm\nthat takes into account such contextual nature, and learns dynamic, flexible,\nand fully contextualized entity and relation embeddings. Two types of graph\ncontexts are studied: edges and paths, both formulated as sequences of entities\nand relations. CoKE takes a sequence as input and uses a Transformer encoder to\nobtain contextualized representations. These representations are hence\nnaturally adaptive to the input, capturing contextual meanings of entities and\nrelations therein. Evaluation on a wide variety of public benchmarks verifies\nthe superiority of CoKE in link prediction and path query answering. It\nperforms consistently better than, or at least equally well as current\nstate-of-the-art in almost every case, in particular offering an absolute\nimprovement of 21.0% in H@10 on path query answering.
