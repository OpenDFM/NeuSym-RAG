    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress recently. On the\none hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful\nconversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad\nrange of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines\nfor domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have\nacquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks\nbecause they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often\nhave errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need\naccurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and\nsystems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain-specific tasks\nvery well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms,\nthey are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore,\nthere is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation\nmodels to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of\nthe sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with\nspecial functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce\nTaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with\nmillions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to\nimprove a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing\nfoundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models\nand systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital\nand physical domains. As a position paper, we will present our vision of how to\nbuild such an ecosystem, explain each key component, and use study cases to\nillustrate both the feasibility of this vision and the main challenges we need\nto address next.",
