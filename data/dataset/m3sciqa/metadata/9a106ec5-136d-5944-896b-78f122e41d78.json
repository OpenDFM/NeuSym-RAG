    "abstract": "In this paper, we cast Legal Judgment Prediction on European Court of Human\nRights cases into an article-aware classification task, where the case outcome\nis classified from a combined input of case facts and convention articles. This\nconfiguration facilitates the model learning some legal reasoning ability in\nmapping article text to specific case fact text. It also provides an\nopportunity to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to zero-shot settings\nwhen asked to classify the case outcome with respect to articles not seen\nduring training. We devise zero-shot experiments and apply domain adaptation\nmethods based on domain discrimination and Wasserstein distance. Our results\ndemonstrate that the article-aware architecture outperforms straightforward\nfact classification. We also find that domain adaptation methods improve\nzero-shot transfer performance, with article relatedness and encoder\npre-training influencing the effect.",
