    "abstract": "Emotion recognition or emotion prediction is a higher approach or a special\ncase of sentiment analysis. In this task, the result is not produced in terms\nof either polarity: positive or negative or in the form of rating (from 1 to 5)\nbut of a more detailed level of analysis in which the results are depicted in\nmore expressions like sadness, enjoyment, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise.\nEmotion recognition plays a critical role in measuring the brand value of a\nproduct by recognizing specific emotions of customers' comments. In this study,\nwe have achieved two targets. First and foremost, we built a standard\nVietnamese Social Media Emotion Corpus (UIT-VSMEC) with exactly 6,927\nemotion-annotated sentences, contributing to emotion recognition research in\nVietnamese which is a low-resource language in natural language processing\n(NLP). Secondly, we assessed and measured machine learning and deep neural\nnetwork models on our UIT-VSMEC corpus. As a result, the CNN model achieved the\nhighest performance with the weighted F1-score of 59.74%. Our corpus is\navailable at our research website.",
