    "abstract": "Accurate and timely detection of medical adverse events (AEs) from free-text\nmedical narratives is challenging. Natural language processing (NLP) with deep\nlearning has already shown great potential for analyzing free-text data, but\nits application for medical AE detection has been limited. In this study we\nproposed deep learning based NLP (DL-NLP) models for efficient and accurate hip\ndislocation AE detection following total hip replacement from standard\n(radiology notes) and non-standard (follow-up telephone notes) free-text\nmedical narratives. We benchmarked these proposed models with a wide variety of\ntraditional machine learning based NLP (ML-NLP) models, and also assessed the\naccuracy of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and Current\nProcedural Terminology (CPT) codes in capturing these hip dislocation AEs in a\nmulti-center orthopaedic registry. All DL-NLP models out-performed all of the\nML-NLP models, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model achieving the\nbest overall performance (Kappa = 0.97 for radiology notes, and Kappa = 1.00\nfor follow-up telephone notes). On the other hand, the ICD/CPT codes of the\npatients who sustained a hip dislocation AE were only 75.24% accurate, showing\nthe potential of the proposed model to be used in largescale orthopaedic\nregistries for accurate and efficient hip dislocation AE detection to improve\nthe quality of care and patient outcome.",
