    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus, a dataset containing almost\n1 million multi-turn dialogues, with a total of over 7 million utterances and\n100 million words. This provides a unique resource for research into building\ndialogue managers based on neural language models that can make use of large\namounts of unlabeled data. The dataset has both the multi-turn property of\nconversations in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, and the\nunstructured nature of interactions from microblog services such as Twitter. We\nalso describe two neural learning architectures suitable for analyzing this\ndataset, and provide benchmark performance on the task of selecting the best\nnext response.",
