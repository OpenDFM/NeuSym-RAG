    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution examples is important for safety-critical\nmachine learning applications such as detecting novel biological phenomena and\nself-driving cars. However, existing research mainly focuses on simple\nsmall-scale settings. To set the stage for more realistic out-of-distribution\ndetection, we depart from small-scale settings and explore large-scale\nmulticlass and multi-label settings with high-resolution images and thousands\nof classes. To make future work in real-world settings possible, we create new\nbenchmarks for three large-scale settings. To test ImageNet multiclass anomaly\ndetectors, we introduce the Species dataset containing over 700,000 images and\nover a thousand anomalous species. We leverage ImageNet-21K to evaluate PASCAL\nVOC and COCO multilabel anomaly detectors. Third, we introduce a new benchmark\nfor anomaly segmentation by introducing a segmentation benchmark with road\nanomalies. We conduct extensive experiments in these more realistic settings\nfor out-of-distribution detection and find that a surprisingly simple detector\nbased on the maximum logit outperforms prior methods in all the large-scale\nmulti-class, multi-label, and segmentation tasks, establishing a simple new\nbaseline for future work.",
