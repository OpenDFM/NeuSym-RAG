    "abstract": "Recently, ChatGPT has drawn great attention from both the research community\nand the public. We are particularly interested in whether it can serve as a\nuniversal sentiment analyzer. To this end, in this work, we provide a\npreliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on the understanding of \\emph{opinions},\n\\emph{sentiments}, and \\emph{emotions} contained in the text. Specifically, we\nevaluate it in three settings, including \\emph{standard} evaluation,\n\\emph{polarity shift} evaluation and \\emph{open-domain} evaluation. We conduct\nan evaluation on 7 representative sentiment analysis tasks covering 17\nbenchmark datasets and compare ChatGPT with fine-tuned BERT and corresponding\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models on them. We also attempt several popular\nprompting techniques to elicit the ability further. Moreover, we conduct human\nevaluation and present some qualitative case studies to gain a deep\ncomprehension of its sentiment analysis capabilities.",
