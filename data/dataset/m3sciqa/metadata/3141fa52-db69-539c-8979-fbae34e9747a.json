    "abstract": "We introduce Voyager, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent\nin Minecraft that continuously explores the world, acquires diverse skills, and\nmakes novel discoveries without human intervention. Voyager consists of three\nkey components: 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, 2) an\never-growing skill library of executable code for storing and retrieving\ncomplex behaviors, and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates\nenvironment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification for program\nimprovement. Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses\nthe need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by Voyager are\ntemporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the\nagent's abilities rapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically,\nVoyager shows strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exhibits\nexceptional proficiency in playing Minecraft. It obtains 3.3x more unique\nitems, travels 2.3x longer distances, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up\nto 15.3x faster than prior SOTA. Voyager is able to utilize the learned skill\nlibrary in a new Minecraft world to solve novel tasks from scratch, while other\ntechniques struggle to generalize. We open-source our full codebase and prompts\nat https://voyager.minedojo.org/.",
