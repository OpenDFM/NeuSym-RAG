    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a deep, globally normalized topic model that\nincorporates structural relationships connecting documents in socially\ngenerated corpora, such as online forums. Our model (1) captures discursive\ninteractions along observed reply links in addition to traditional topic\ninformation, and (2) incorporates latent distributed representations arranged\nin a deep architecture, which enables a GPU-based mean-field inference\nprocedure that scales efficiently to large data. We apply our model to a new\nsocial media dataset consisting of 13M comments mined from the popular internet\nforum Reddit, a domain that poses significant challenges to models that do not\naccount for relationships connecting user comments. We evaluate against\nexisting methods across multiple metrics including perplexity and metadata\nprediction, and qualitatively analyze the learned interaction patterns.",
