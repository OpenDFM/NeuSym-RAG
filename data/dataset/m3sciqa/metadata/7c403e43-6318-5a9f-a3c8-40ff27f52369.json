    "abstract": "Discriminative neural networks offer little or no performance guarantees when\ndeployed on data not generated by the same process as the training\ndistribution. On such out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, the prediction may not\nonly be erroneous, but confidently so, limiting the safe deployment of\nclassifiers in real-world applications. One such challenging application is\nbacteria identification based on genomic sequences, which holds the promise of\nearly detection of diseases, but requires a model that can output low\nconfidence predictions on OOD genomic sequences from new bacteria that were not\npresent in the training data. We introduce a genomics dataset for OOD detection\nthat allows other researchers to benchmark progress on this important problem.\nWe investigate deep generative model based approaches for OOD detection and\nobserve that the likelihood score is heavily affected by population level\nbackground statistics. We propose a likelihood ratio method for deep generative\nmodels which effectively corrects for these confounding background statistics.\nWe benchmark the OOD detection performance of the proposed method against\nexisting approaches on the genomics dataset and show that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate the generality of the proposed\nmethod by showing that it significantly improves OOD detection when applied to\ndeep generative models of images.",
