    "abstract": "Existing datasets for natural language inference (NLI) have propelled\nresearch on language understanding. We propose a new method for automatically\nderiving NLI datasets from the growing abundance of large-scale question\nanswering datasets. Our approach hinges on learning a sentence transformation\nmodel which converts question-answer pairs into their declarative forms.\nDespite being primarily trained on a single QA dataset, we show that it can be\nsuccessfully applied to a variety of other QA resources. Using this system, we\nautomatically derive a new freely available dataset of over 500k NLI examples\n(QA-NLI), and show that it exhibits a wide range of inference phenomena rarely\nseen in previous NLI datasets.",
