    "abstract": "Affective Computing is the study of how computers can recognize, interpret\nand simulate human affects. Sentiment Analysis is a common task inNLP related\nto this topic, but it focuses only on emotion valence (positive, negative,\nneutral). An emerging approach in NLP is Emotion Recognition, which relies on\nfined-grained classification. This research describes an approach to create a\nlexical-based weakly supervised corpus for fine-grained emotion in Portuguese.\nWe evaluated our dataset by fine-tuning a transformer-based language model\n(BERT) and validating it on a Gold Standard annotated validation set. Our\nresults (F1-score=.64) suggest lexical-based weak supervision as an appropriate\nstrategy for initial work in low resourced environment.",
