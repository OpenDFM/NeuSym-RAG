    "abstract": "With the recent advance in large pre-trained language models, researchers\nhave achieved record performances in NLP tasks that mostly focus on language\npattern matching. The community is experiencing the shift of the challenge from\nhow to model language to the imitation of complex reasoning abilities like\nhuman beings. In this work, we investigate the application domain of finance\nthat involves real-world, complex numerical reasoning. We propose a new\nlarge-scale dataset, ConvFinQA, aiming to study the chain of numerical\nreasoning in conversational question answering. Our dataset poses great\nchallenge in modeling long-range, complex numerical reasoning paths in\nreal-world conversations. We conduct comprehensive experiments and analyses\nwith both the neural symbolic methods and the prompting-based methods, to\nprovide insights into the reasoning mechanisms of these two divisions. We\nbelieve our new dataset should serve as a valuable resource to push forward the\nexploration of real-world, complex reasoning tasks as the next research focus.\nOur dataset and code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/czyssrs/ConvFinQA.",
