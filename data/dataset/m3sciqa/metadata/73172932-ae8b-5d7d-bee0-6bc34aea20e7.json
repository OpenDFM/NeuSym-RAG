    "abstract": "We propose Grounded Adaptation for Zero-shot Executable Semantic Parsing\n(GAZP) to adapt an existing semantic parser to new environments (e.g. new\ndatabase schemas). GAZP combines a forward semantic parser with a backward\nutterance generator to synthesize data (e.g. utterances and SQL queries) in the\nnew environment, then selects cycle-consistent examples to adapt the parser.\nUnlike data-augmentation, which typically synthesizes unverified examples in\nthe training environment, GAZP synthesizes examples in the new environment\nwhose input-output consistency are verified. On the Spider, Sparc, and CoSQL\nzero-shot semantic parsing tasks, GAZP improves logical form and execution\naccuracy of the baseline parser. Our analyses show that GAZP outperforms\ndata-augmentation in the training environment, performance increases with the\namount of GAZP-synthesized data, and cycle-consistency is central to successful\nadaptation.",
