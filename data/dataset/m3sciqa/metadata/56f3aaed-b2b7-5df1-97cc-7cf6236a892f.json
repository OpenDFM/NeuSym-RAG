    "abstract": "Text segmentation aims to divide text into contiguous, semantically coherent\nsegments, while segment labeling deals with producing labels for each segment.\nPast work has shown success in tackling segmentation and labeling for documents\nand conversations. This has been possible with a combination of task-specific\npipelines, supervised and unsupervised learning objectives. In this work, we\npropose a single encoder-decoder neural network that can handle long documents\nand conversations, trained simultaneously for both segmentation and segment\nlabeling using only standard supervision. We successfully show a way to solve\nthe combined task as a pure generation task, which we refer to as structured\nsummarization. We apply the same technique to both document and conversational\ndata, and we show state of the art performance across datasets for both\nsegmentation and labeling, under both high- and low-resource settings. Our\nresults establish a strong case for considering text segmentation and segment\nlabeling as a whole, and moving towards general-purpose techniques that don't\ndepend on domain expertise or task-specific components.",
