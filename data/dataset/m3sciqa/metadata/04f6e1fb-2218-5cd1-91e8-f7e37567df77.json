    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have recently been shown to be quite\nsuccessful in modeling graph-structured data. However, the primary focus has\nbeen on handling simple undirected graphs. Multi-relational graphs are a more\ngeneral and prevalent form of graphs where each edge has a label and direction\nassociated with it. Most of the existing approaches to handle such graphs\nsuffer from over-parameterization and are restricted to learning\nrepresentations of nodes only. In this paper, we propose CompGCN, a novel Graph\nConvolutional framework which jointly embeds both nodes and relations in a\nrelational graph. CompGCN leverages a variety of entity-relation composition\noperations from Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques and scales with the number\nof relations. It also generalizes several of the existing multi-relational GCN\nmethods. We evaluate our proposed method on multiple tasks such as node\nclassification, link prediction, and graph classification, and achieve\ndemonstrably superior results. We make the source code of CompGCN available to\nfoster reproducible research.",
