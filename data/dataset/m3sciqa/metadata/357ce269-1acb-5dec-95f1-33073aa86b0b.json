    "abstract": "Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) efficiently reduces\nlabor costs but meanwhile intrinsically suffers from the label noise due to the\nstrong assumption of distant supervision. Typically, the wrongly labeled\ninstances comprise numbers of incomplete and inaccurate annotation noise, while\nmost prior denoising works are only concerned with one kind of noise and fail\nto fully explore useful information in the whole training set. To address this\nissue, we propose a robust learning paradigm named Self-Collaborative Denoising\nLearning (SCDL), which jointly trains two teacher-student networks in a\nmutually-beneficial manner to iteratively perform noisy label refinery. Each\nnetwork is designed to exploit reliable labels via self denoising, and two\nnetworks communicate with each other to explore unreliable annotations by\ncollaborative denoising. Extensive experimental results on five real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that SCDL is superior to state-of-the-art DS-NER denoising\nmethods.",
