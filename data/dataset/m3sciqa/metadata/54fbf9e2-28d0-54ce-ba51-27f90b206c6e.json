    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expanding in\npopularity for broad applications to challenging tasks in chemistry and\nmaterials science. Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery\nof new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to\nread and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings\nare a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular\nstring representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late\n1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several\nshortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid\nresults with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new\nlanguage for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\\% robustness:\nSELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings). SELFIES has since simplified and\nenabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this manuscript, we look to\nthe future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their\nrespective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete Future Projects\nfor robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new\nchemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust\nlanguages and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these\nproposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of\nmolecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and\nmaterials science.",
