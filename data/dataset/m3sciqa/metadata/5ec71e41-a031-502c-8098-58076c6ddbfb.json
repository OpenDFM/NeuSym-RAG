    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is one of the most fundamental tasks in Natural Language\nProcessing. Popular languages like English, Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, and also\nIndian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Tamil have seen a significant amount\nof work in this area. However, the Marathi language which is the third most\npopular language in India still lags behind due to the absence of proper\ndatasets. In this paper, we present the first major publicly available Marathi\nSentiment Analysis Dataset - L3CubeMahaSent. It is curated using tweets\nextracted from various Maharashtrian personalities' Twitter accounts. Our\ndataset consists of ~16,000 distinct tweets classified in three broad classes\nviz. positive, negative, and neutral. We also present the guidelines using\nwhich we annotated the tweets. Finally, we present the statistics of our\ndataset and baseline classification results using CNN, LSTM, ULMFiT, and\nBERT-based deep learning models.",
