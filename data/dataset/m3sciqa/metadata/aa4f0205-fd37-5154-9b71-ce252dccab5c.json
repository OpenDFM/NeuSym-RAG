    "abstract": "Building models that can be rapidly adapted to novel tasks using only a\nhandful of annotated examples is an open challenge for multimodal machine\nlearning research. We introduce Flamingo, a family of Visual Language Models\n(VLM) with this ability. We propose key architectural innovations to: (i)\nbridge powerful pretrained vision-only and language-only models, (ii) handle\nsequences of arbitrarily interleaved visual and textual data, and (iii)\nseamlessly ingest images or videos as inputs. Thanks to their flexibility,\nFlamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing\narbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with\nin-context few-shot learning capabilities. We perform a thorough evaluation of\nour models, exploring and measuring their ability to rapidly adapt to a variety\nof image and video tasks. These include open-ended tasks such as visual\nquestion-answering, where the model is prompted with a question which it has to\nanswer; captioning tasks, which evaluate the ability to describe a scene or an\nevent; and close-ended tasks such as multiple-choice visual question-answering.\nFor tasks lying anywhere on this spectrum, a single Flamingo model can achieve\na new state of the art with few-shot learning, simply by prompting the model\nwith task-specific examples. On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms\nmodels fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data.",
