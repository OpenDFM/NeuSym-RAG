    "abstract": "Many real-world open-domain conversation applications have specific goals to\nachieve during open-ended chats, such as recommendation, psychotherapy,\neducation, etc. We study the problem of imposing conversational goals on\nopen-domain chat agents. In particular, we want a conversational system to chat\nnaturally with human and proactively guide the conversation to a designated\ntarget subject. The problem is challenging as no public data is available for\nlearning such a target-guided strategy. We propose a structured approach that\nintroduces coarse-grained keywords to control the intended content of system\nresponses. We then attain smooth conversation transition through turn-level\nsupervised learning, and drive the conversation towards the target with\ndiscourse-level constraints. We further derive a keyword-augmented conversation\ndataset for the study. Quantitative and human evaluations show our system can\nproduce meaningful and effective conversations, significantly improving over\nother approaches.",
