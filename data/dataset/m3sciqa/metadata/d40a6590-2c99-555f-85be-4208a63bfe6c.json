    "abstract": "Open Domain Question Answering (QA) is evolving from complex pipelined\nsystems to end-to-end deep neural networks. Specialized neural models have been\ndeveloped for extracting answers from either text alone or Knowledge Bases\n(KBs) alone. In this paper we look at a more practical setting, namely QA over\nthe combination of a KB and entity-linked text, which is appropriate when an\nincomplete KB is available with a large text corpus. Building on recent\nadvances in graph representation learning we propose a novel model, GRAFT-Net,\nfor extracting answers from a question-specific subgraph containing text and KB\nentities and relations. We construct a suite of benchmark tasks for this\nproblem, varying the difficulty of questions, the amount of training data, and\nKB completeness. We show that GRAFT-Net is competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art when tested using either KBs or text alone, and vastly\noutperforms existing methods in the combined setting.
