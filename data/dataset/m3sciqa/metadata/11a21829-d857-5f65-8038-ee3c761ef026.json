    "abstract": "We study the problem of training named entity recognition (NER) models using\nonly distantly-labeled data, which can be automatically obtained by matching\nentity mentions in the raw text with entity types in a knowledge base. The\nbiggest challenge of distantly-supervised NER is that the distant supervision\nmay induce incomplete and noisy labels, rendering the straightforward\napplication of supervised learning ineffective. In this paper, we propose (1) a\nnoise-robust learning scheme comprised of a new loss function and a noisy label\nremoval step, for training NER models on distantly-labeled data, and (2) a\nself-training method that uses contextualized augmentations created by\npre-trained language models to improve the generalization ability of the NER\nmodel. On three benchmark datasets, our method achieves superior performance,\noutperforming existing distantly-supervised NER models by significant margins.",
