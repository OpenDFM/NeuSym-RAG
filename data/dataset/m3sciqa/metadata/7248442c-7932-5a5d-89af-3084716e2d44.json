    "abstract": "Integrating robots in complex everyday environments requires a multitude of\nproblems to be solved. One crucial feature among those is to equip robots with\na mechanism for teaching them a new task in an easy and natural way. When\nteaching tasks that involve sequences of different skills, with varying order\nand number of these skills, it is desirable to only demonstrate full task\nexecutions instead of all individual skills. For this purpose, we propose a\nnovel approach that simultaneously learns to segment trajectories into\nreoccurring patterns and the skills to reconstruct these patterns from\nunlabelled demonstrations without further supervision. Moreover, the approach\nlearns a skill conditioning that can be used to understand possible sequences\nof skills, a practical mechanism to be used in, for example,\nhuman-robot-interactions for a more intelligent and adaptive robot behaviour.\nThe Bayesian and variational inference based approach is evaluated on synthetic\nand real human demonstrations with varying complexities and dimensionality,\nshowing the successful learning of segmentations and skill libraries from\nunlabelled data.",
