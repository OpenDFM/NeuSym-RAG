    "abstract": "Previous work has largely considered the fairness of image captioning systems\nthrough the underspecified lens of \"bias.\" In contrast, we present a set of\ntechniques for measuring five types of representational harms, as well as the\nresulting measurements obtained for two of the most popular image captioning\ndatasets using a state-of-the-art image captioning system. Our goal was not to\naudit this image captioning system, but rather to develop normatively grounded\nmeasurement techniques, in turn providing an opportunity to reflect on the many\nchallenges involved. We propose multiple measurement techniques for each type\nof harm. We argue that by doing so, we are better able to capture the\nmulti-faceted nature of each type of harm, in turn improving the (collective)\nvalidity of the resulting measurements. Throughout, we discuss the assumptions\nunderlying our measurement approach and point out when they do not hold.",
