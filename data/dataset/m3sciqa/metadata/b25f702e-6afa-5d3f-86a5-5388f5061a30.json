    "abstract": "Controllable text generation (CTG) aims to generate text with desired\nattributes, and decoding-time-based methods have shown promising performance on\nthis task. However, in this paper, we identify the phenomenon of Attribute\nCollapse for the first time. It causes the fluency of generated text to rapidly\ndecrease when the control strength exceeds a critical value, rendering the text\ncompletely unusable. This limitation hinders the effectiveness of decoding\nmethods in achieving high levels of controllability. To address this problem,\nwe propose a novel lightweight decoding framework named Air-Decoding. Its main\nidea is reconstructing the attribute distributions to balance the weights\nbetween attribute words and non-attribute words to generate more fluent text.\nSpecifically, we train prefixes by prefix-tuning to obtain attribute\ndistributions. Then we design a novel attribute distribution reconstruction\nmethod to balance the obtained distributions and use the reconstructed\ndistributions to guide language models for generation, effectively avoiding the\nissue of Attribute Collapse. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks prove that our\nmethod achieves a new state-of-the-art control performance.",
