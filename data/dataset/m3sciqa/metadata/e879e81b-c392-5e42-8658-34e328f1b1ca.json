    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task for reliable machine\nlearning. Recent advances in representation learning give rise to\ndistance-based OOD detection, where testing samples are detected as OOD if they\nare relatively far away from the centroids or prototypes of in-distribution\n(ID) classes. However, prior methods directly take off-the-shelf contrastive\nlosses that suffice for classifying ID samples, but are not optimally designed\nwhen test inputs contain OOD samples. In this work, we propose CIDER, a novel\nrepresentation learning framework that exploits hyperspherical embeddings for\nOOD detection. CIDER jointly optimizes two losses to promote strong ID-OOD\nseparability: a dispersion loss that promotes large angular distances among\ndifferent class prototypes, and a compactness loss that encourages samples to\nbe close to their class prototypes. We analyze and establish the unexplored\nrelationship between OOD detection performance and the embedding properties in\nthe hyperspherical space, and demonstrate the importance of dispersion and\ncompactness. CIDER establishes superior performance, outperforming the latest\nrival by 19.36% in FPR95. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/cider.",
