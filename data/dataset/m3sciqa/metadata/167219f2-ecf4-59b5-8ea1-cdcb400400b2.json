    "abstract": "We present the shared task on Fine-Grained Propaganda Detection, which was\norganized as part of the NLP4IF workshop at EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. There were two\nsubtasks. FLC is a fragment-level task that asks for the identification of\npropagandist text fragments in a news article and also for the prediction of\nthe specific propaganda technique used in each such fragment (18-way\nclassification task). SLC is a sentence-level binary classification task asking\nto detect the sentences that contain propaganda. A total of 12 teams submitted\nsystems for the FLC task, 25 teams did so for the SLC task, and 14 teams\neventually submitted a system description paper. For both subtasks, most\nsystems managed to beat the baseline by a sizable margin. The leaderboard and\nthe data from the competition are available at\nhttp://propaganda.qcri.org/nlp4if-shared-task/.",
