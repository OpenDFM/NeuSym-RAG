    "abstract": "Developing an efficient retriever to retrieve knowledge from a large-scale\nknowledge base (KB) is critical for task-oriented dialogue systems to\neffectively handle localized and specialized tasks. However, widely used\ngenerative models such as T5 and ChatGPT often struggle to differentiate subtle\ndifferences among the retrieved KB records when generating responses, resulting\nin suboptimal quality of generated responses. In this paper, we propose the\napplication of maximal marginal likelihood to train a perceptive retriever by\nutilizing signals from response generation for supervision. In addition, our\napproach goes beyond considering solely retrieved entities and incorporates\nvarious meta knowledge to guide the generator, thus improving the utilization\nof knowledge. We evaluate our approach on three task-oriented dialogue datasets\nusing T5 and ChatGPT as the backbone models. The results demonstrate that when\ncombined with meta knowledge, the response generator can effectively leverage\nhigh-quality knowledge records from the retriever and enhance the quality of\ngenerated responses.
