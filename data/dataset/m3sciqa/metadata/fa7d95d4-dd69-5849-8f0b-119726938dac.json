    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) have shown effectiveness with different\nprompting methods, such as Chain of Thought, Program of Thought, we find that\nthese methods have formed a great complementarity to each other on math\nreasoning tasks. In this work, we propose XoT, an integrated problem solving\nframework by prompting LLMs with diverse reasoning thoughts. For each question,\nXoT always begins with selecting the most suitable method then executes each\nmethod iteratively. Within each iteration, XoT actively checks the validity of\nthe generated answer and incorporates the feedback from external executors,\nallowing it to dynamically switch among different prompting methods. Through\nextensive experiments on 10 popular math reasoning datasets, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach and thoroughly analyze the strengths of\neach module. Moreover, empirical results suggest that our framework is\northogonal to recent work that makes improvements on single reasoning methods\nand can further generalise to logical reasoning domain. By allowing method\nswitching, XoT provides a fresh perspective on the collaborative integration of\ndiverse reasoning thoughts in a unified framework.
