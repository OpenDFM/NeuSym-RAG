    "abstract": "Target-guided open-domain conversation aims to proactively and naturally\nguide a dialogue agent or human to achieve specific goals, topics or keywords\nduring open-ended conversations. Existing methods mainly rely on single-turn\ndatadriven learning and simple target-guided strategy without considering\nsemantic or factual knowledge relations among candidate topics/keywords. This\nresults in poor transition smoothness and low success rate. In this work, we\nadopt a structured approach that controls the intended content of system\nresponses by introducing coarse-grained keywords, attains smooth conversation\ntransition through turn-level supervised learning and knowledge relations\nbetween candidate keywords, and drives an conversation towards an specified\ntarget with discourse-level guiding strategy. Specially, we propose a novel\ndynamic knowledge routing network (DKRN) which considers semantic knowledge\nrelations among candidate keywords for accurate next topic prediction of next\ndiscourse. With the help of more accurate keyword prediction, our\nkeyword-augmented response retrieval module can achieve better retrieval\nperformance and more meaningful conversations. Besides, we also propose a novel\ndual discourse-level target-guided strategy to guide conversations to reach\ntheir goals smoothly with higher success rate. Furthermore, to push the\nresearch boundary of target-guided open-domain conversation to match real-world\nscenarios better, we introduce a new large-scale Chinese target-guided\nopen-domain conversation dataset (more than 900K conversations) crawled from\nSina Weibo. Quantitative and human evaluations show our method can produce\nmeaningful and effective target-guided conversations, significantly improving\nover other state-of-the-art methods by more than 20% in success rate and more\nthan 0.6 in average smoothness score.",
