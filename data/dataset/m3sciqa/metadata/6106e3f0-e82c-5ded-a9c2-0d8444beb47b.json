    "abstract": "Knowledge-grounded dialogue systems powered by large language models often\ngenerate responses that, while fluent, are not attributable to a relevant\nsource of information. Progress towards models that do not exhibit this issue\nrequires evaluation metrics that can quantify its prevalence. To this end, we\nintroduce the Benchmark for Evaluation of Grounded INteraction (BEGIN),\ncomprised of 12k dialogue turns generated by neural dialogue systems trained on\nthree knowledge-grounded dialogue corpora. We collect human annotations\nassessing the extent to which the models' responses can be attributed to the\ngiven background information. We then use BEGIN to analyze eight evaluation\nmetrics. We find that these metrics rely on spurious correlations, do not\nreliably distinguish attributable abstractive responses from unattributable\nones, and perform substantially worse when the knowledge source is longer. Our\nfindings underscore the need for more sophisticated and robust evaluation\nmetrics for knowledge-grounded dialogue. We make BEGIN publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/google/BEGIN-dataset.",
