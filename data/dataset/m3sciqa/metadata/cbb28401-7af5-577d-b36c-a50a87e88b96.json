    "abstract": "Many tasks in natural language processing, ranging from machine translation\nto question answering, can be reduced to the problem of matching two sentences\nor more generally two short texts. We propose a new approach to the problem,\ncalled Deep Match Tree (DeepMatch$_{tree}$), under a general setting. The\napproach consists of two components, 1) a mining algorithm to discover patterns\nfor matching two short-texts, defined in the product space of dependency trees,\nand 2) a deep neural network for matching short texts using the mined patterns,\nas well as a learning algorithm to build the network having a sparse structure.\nWe test our algorithm on the problem of matching a tweet and a response in\nsocial media, a hard matching problem proposed in [Wang et al., 2013], and show\nthat DeepMatch$_{tree}$ can outperform a number of competitor models including\none without using dependency trees and one based on word-embedding, all with\nlarge margins",
