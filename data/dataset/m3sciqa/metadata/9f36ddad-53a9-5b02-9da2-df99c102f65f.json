    "abstract": "Core to the vision-and-language navigation (VLN) challenge is building robust\ninstruction representations and action decoding schemes, which can generalize\nwell to previously unseen instructions and environments. In this paper, we\nreport two simple but highly effective methods to address these challenges and\nlead to a new state-of-the-art performance. First, we adapt large-scale\npretrained language models to learn text representations that generalize better\nto previously unseen instructions. Second, we propose a stochastic sampling\nscheme to reduce the considerable gap between the expert actions in training\nand sampled actions in test, so that the agent can learn to correct its own\nmistakes during long sequential action decoding. Combining the two techniques,\nwe achieve a new state of the art on the Room-to-Room benchmark with 6%\nabsolute gain over the previous best result (47% -> 53%) on the Success Rate\nweighted by Path Length metric.",
