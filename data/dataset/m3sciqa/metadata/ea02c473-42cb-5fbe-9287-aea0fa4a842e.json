    "abstract": "We present a neural approach called IRNet for complex and cross-domain\nText-to-SQL. IRNet aims to address two challenges: 1) the mismatch between\nintents expressed in natural language (NL) and the implementation details in\nSQL; 2) the challenge in predicting columns caused by the large number of\nout-of-domain words. Instead of end-to-end synthesizing a SQL query, IRNet\ndecomposes the synthesis process into three phases. In the first phase, IRNet\nperforms a schema linking over a question and a database schema. Then, IRNet\nadopts a grammar-based neural model to synthesize a SemQL query which is an\nintermediate representation that we design to bridge NL and SQL. Finally, IRNet\ndeterministically infers a SQL query from the synthesized SemQL query with\ndomain knowledge. On the challenging Text-to-SQL benchmark Spider, IRNet\nachieves 46.7% accuracy, obtaining 19.5% absolute improvement over previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches. At the time of writing, IRNet achieves the first\nposition on the Spider leaderboard.",
