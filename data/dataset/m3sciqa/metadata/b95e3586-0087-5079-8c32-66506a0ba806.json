    "abstract": "We study societal bias amplification in image captioning. Image captioning\nmodels have been shown to perpetuate gender and racial biases, however, metrics\nto measure, quantify, and evaluate the societal bias in captions are not yet\nstandardized. We provide a comprehensive study on the strengths and limitations\nof each metric, and propose LIC, a metric to study captioning bias\namplification. We argue that, for image captioning, it is not enough to focus\non the correct prediction of the protected attribute, and the whole context\nshould be taken into account. We conduct extensive evaluation on traditional\nand state-of-the-art image captioning models, and surprisingly find that, by\nonly focusing on the protected attribute prediction, bias mitigation models are\nunexpectedly amplifying bias.",
