    "abstract": "Simultaneous translation, which translates sentences before they are\nfinished, is useful in many scenarios but is notoriously difficult due to\nword-order differences. While the conventional seq-to-seq framework is only\nsuitable for full-sentence translation, we propose a novel prefix-to-prefix\nframework for simultaneous translation that implicitly learns to anticipate in\na single translation model. Within this framework, we present a very simple yet\nsurprisingly effective wait-k policy trained to generate the target sentence\nconcurrently with the source sentence, but always k words behind. Experiments\nshow our strategy achieves low latency and reasonable quality (compared to\nfull-sentence translation) on 4 directions: zh<->en and de<->en.",
