    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in natural language generation, it remains\nchallenging to control attributes of generated text. We propose DExperts:\nDecoding-time Experts, a decoding-time method for controlled text generation\nthat combines a pretrained language model with \"expert\" LMs and/or\n\"anti-expert\" LMs in a product of experts. Intuitively, under the ensemble,\ntokens only get high probability if they are considered likely by the experts,\nand unlikely by the anti-experts. We apply DExperts to language detoxification\nand sentiment-controlled generation, where we outperform existing controllable\ngeneration methods on both automatic and human evaluations. Moreover, because\nDExperts operates only on the output of the pretrained LM, it is effective with\n(anti-)experts of smaller size, including when operating on GPT-3. Our work\nhighlights the promise of tuning small LMs on text with (un)desirable\nattributes for efficient decoding-time steering.",
