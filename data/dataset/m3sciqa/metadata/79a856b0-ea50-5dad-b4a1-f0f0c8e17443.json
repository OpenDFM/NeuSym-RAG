    "abstract": "Propaganda is a form of deceptive narratives that instigate or mislead the\npublic, usually with a political purpose. In this paper, we aim to identify\npropaganda in political news at two fine-grained levels: sentence-level and\ntoken-level. We observe that propaganda content is more likely to be embedded\nin sentences that attribute causality or assert contrast to nearby sentences,\nas well as seen in opinionated evaluation, speculation and discussions of\nfuture expectation. Hence, we propose to incorporate both local and global\ndiscourse structures for propaganda discovery and construct two teacher models\nfor identifying PDTB-style discourse relations between nearby sentences and\ncommon discourse roles of sentences in a news article respectively. We further\ndevise two methods to incorporate the two types of discourse structures for\npropaganda identification by either using teacher predicted probabilities as\nadditional features or soliciting guidance in a knowledge distillation\nframework. Experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that leveraging\nguidance from discourse structures can significantly improve both precision and\nrecall of propaganda content identification.",
