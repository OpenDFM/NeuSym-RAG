    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in abstractive summarization, current summarization\nsystems still suffer from content hallucinations where models generate text\nthat is either irrelevant or contradictory to the source document. However,\nprior work has been predicated on the assumption that any generated facts not\nappearing explicitly in the source are undesired hallucinations. Methods have\nbeen proposed to address this scenario by ultimately improving `faithfulness'\nto the source document, but in reality, there is a large portion of entities in\nthe gold reference targets that are not directly in the source. In this work,\nwe show that these entities are not aberrations, but they instead require\nutilizing external world knowledge to infer reasoning paths from entities in\nthe source. We show that by utilizing an external knowledge base, we can\nimprove the faithfulness of summaries without simply making them more\nextractive, and additionally, we show that external knowledge bases linked from\nthe source can benefit the factuality of generated summaries.",
