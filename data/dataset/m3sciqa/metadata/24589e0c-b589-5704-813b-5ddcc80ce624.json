    "abstract": "Attribute-based Controlled Text Generation (CTG) refers to generating\nsentences that satisfy desirable attributes (e.g., emotions and topics).\nExisting works often utilize fine-tuning or resort to extra attribute\nclassifiers, yet suffer from storage and inference time increases. To address\nthese concerns, we explore attribute-based CTG in a prompt-based manner. In\nshort, the proposed Tailor represents each attribute as a pre-trained\ncontinuous vector (i.e., single-attribute prompt) and guides the generation of\na fixed PLM switch to a pre-specified attribute. We experimentally find that\nthese prompts can be simply concatenated as a whole to multi-attribute CTG\nwithout any re-training, yet raises problems of fluency decrease and position\nsensitivity. To this end, Tailor provides a multi-attribute prompt mask and a\nre-indexing position-ids sequence to bridge the gap between the training (one\nprompt for each task) and testing stage (concatenating more than one prompt).\nTo further enhance such single-attribute prompt combinations, Tailor also\nintroduces a trainable prompt connector, which can be concatenated with any two\nsingle-attribute prompts to multi-attribute text generation. Experiments on 11\nattribute-specific generation tasks demonstrate strong performances of Tailor\non both single-attribute and multi-attribute CTG, with 0.08\\% training\nparameters of a GPT-2.",
