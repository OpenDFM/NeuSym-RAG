    "abstract": "This paper presents the Norwegian Review Corpus (NoReC), created for training\nand evaluating models for document-level sentiment analysis. The full-text\nreviews have been collected from major Norwegian news sources and cover a range\nof different domains, including literature, movies, video games, restaurants,\nmusic and theater, in addition to product reviews across a range of categories.\nEach review is labeled with a manually assigned score of 1-6, as provided by\nthe rating of the original author. This first release of the corpus comprises\nmore than 35,000 reviews. It is distributed using the CoNLL-U format,\npre-processed using UDPipe, along with a rich set of metadata. The work\nreported in this paper forms part of the SANT initiative (Sentiment Analysis\nfor Norwegian Text), a project seeking to provide resources and tools for\nsentiment analysis and opinion mining for Norwegian. As resources for sentiment\nanalysis have so far been unavailable for Norwegian, NoReC represents a highly\nvaluable and sought-after addition to Norwegian language technology.",
