    "abstract": "Faceted summarization provides briefings of a document from different\nperspectives. Readers can quickly comprehend the main points of a long document\nwith the help of a structured outline. However, little research has been\nconducted on this subject, partially due to the lack of large-scale faceted\nsummarization datasets. In this study, we present FacetSum, a faceted\nsummarization benchmark built on Emerald journal articles, covering a diverse\nrange of domains. Different from traditional document-summary pairs, FacetSum\nprovides multiple summaries, each targeted at specific sections of a long\ndocument, including the purpose, method, findings, and value. Analyses and\nempirical results on our dataset reveal the importance of bringing structure\ninto summaries. We believe FacetSum will spur further advances in summarization\nresearch and foster the development of NLP systems that can leverage the\nstructured information in both long texts and summaries.",
