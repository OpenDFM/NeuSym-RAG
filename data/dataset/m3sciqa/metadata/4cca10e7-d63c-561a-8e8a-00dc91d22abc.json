    "abstract": "Generic summaries try to cover an entire document and query-based summaries\ntry to answer document-specific questions. But real users' needs often fall in\nbetween these extremes and correspond to aspects, high-level topics discussed\namong similar types of documents. In this paper, we collect a dataset of\nrealistic aspect-oriented summaries, AspectNews, which covers different\nsubtopics about articles in news sub-domains. We annotate data across two\ndomains of articles, earthquakes and fraud investigations, where each article\nis annotated with two distinct summaries focusing on different aspects for each\ndomain. A system producing a single generic summary cannot concisely satisfy\nboth aspects. Our focus in evaluation is how well existing techniques can\ngeneralize to these domains without seeing in-domain training data, so we turn\nto techniques to construct synthetic training data that have been used in\nquery-focused summarization work. We compare several training schemes that\ndiffer in how strongly keywords are used and how oracle summaries are\nextracted. Our evaluation shows that our final approach yields (a) focused\nsummaries, better than those from a generic summarization system or from\nkeyword matching; (b) a system sensitive to the choice of keywords.",
