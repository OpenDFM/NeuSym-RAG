    "abstract": "Knowledge plays a critical role in artificial intelligence. Recently, the\nextensive success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has raised significant\nattention about how knowledge can be acquired, maintained, updated and used by\nlanguage models. Despite the enormous amount of related studies, there still\nlacks a unified view of how knowledge circulates within language models\nthroughout the learning, tuning, and application processes, which may prevent\nus from further understanding the connections between current progress or\nrealizing existing limitations. In this survey, we revisit PLMs as\nknowledge-based systems by dividing the life circle of knowledge in PLMs into\nfive critical periods, and investigating how knowledge circulates when it is\nbuilt, maintained and used. To this end, we systematically review existing\nstudies of each period of the knowledge life cycle, summarize the main\nchallenges and current limitations, and discuss future directions.",
