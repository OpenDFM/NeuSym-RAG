    "abstract": "Current event-centric knowledge graphs highly rely on explicit connectives to\nmine relations between events. Unfortunately, due to the sparsity of\nconnectives, these methods severely undermine the coverage of EventKGs. The\nlack of high-quality labelled corpora further exacerbates that problem. In this\npaper, we propose a knowledge projection paradigm for event relation\nextraction: projecting discourse knowledge to narratives by exploiting the\ncommonalities between them. Specifically, we propose Multi-tier Knowledge\nProjection Network (MKPNet), which can leverage multi-tier discourse knowledge\neffectively for event relation extraction. In this way, the labelled data\nrequirement is significantly reduced, and implicit event relations can be\neffectively extracted. Intrinsic experimental results show that MKPNet achieves\nthe new state-of-the-art performance, and extrinsic experimental results verify\nthe value of the extracted event relations.",
