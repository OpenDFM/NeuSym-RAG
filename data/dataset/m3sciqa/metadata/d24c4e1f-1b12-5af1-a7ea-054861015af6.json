    "abstract": "Neural task-oriented dialogue systems often struggle to smoothly interface\nwith a knowledge base. In this work, we seek to address this problem by\nproposing a new neural dialogue agent that is able to effectively sustain\ngrounded, multi-domain discourse through a novel key-value retrieval mechanism.\nThe model is end-to-end differentiable and does not need to explicitly model\ndialogue state or belief trackers. We also release a new dataset of 3,031\ndialogues that are grounded through underlying knowledge bases and span three\ndistinct tasks in the in-car personal assistant space: calendar scheduling,\nweather information retrieval, and point-of-interest navigation. Our\narchitecture is simultaneously trained on data from all domains and\nsignificantly outperforms a competitive rule-based system and other existing\nneural dialogue architectures on the provided domains according to both\nautomatic and human evaluation metrics.",
