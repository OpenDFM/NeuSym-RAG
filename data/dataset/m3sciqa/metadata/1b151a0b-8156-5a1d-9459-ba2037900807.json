    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence and is\napplicable in various fields, including science, engineering, finance, and\neveryday life. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable\nof solving math problems and proving theorems has garnered significant interest\nin the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. For example,\nmathematics serves as a testbed for aspects of reasoning that are challenging\nfor powerful deep learning models, driving new algorithmic and modeling\nadvances. On the other hand, recent advances in large-scale neural language\nmodels have opened up new benchmarks and opportunities to use deep learning for\nmathematical reasoning. In this survey paper, we review the key tasks,\ndatasets, and methods at the intersection of mathematical reasoning and deep\nlearning over the past decade. We also evaluate existing benchmarks and\nmethods, and discuss future research directions in this domain.",
