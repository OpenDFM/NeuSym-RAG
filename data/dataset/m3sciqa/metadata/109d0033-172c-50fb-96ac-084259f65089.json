    "abstract": "Predicting multiple heterogeneous biological and medical targets is a\nchallenge for traditional deep learning models. In contrast to single-task\nlearning, in which a separate model is trained for each target, multi-task\nlearning (MTL) optimizes a single model to predict multiple related targets\nsimultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-gate\nMixture-of-Experts with Exclusivity (MMoEEx). Our work aims to tackle the\nheterogeneous MTL setting, in which the same model optimizes multiple tasks\nwith different characteristics. Such a scenario can overwhelm current MTL\napproaches due to the challenges in balancing shared and task-specific\nrepresentations and the need to optimize tasks with competing optimization\npaths. Our method makes two key contributions: first, we introduce an approach\nto induce more diversity among experts, thus creating representations more\nsuitable for highly imbalanced and heterogenous MTL learning; second, we adopt\na two-step optimization [6, 11] approach to balancing the tasks at the gradient\nlevel. We validate our method on three MTL benchmark datasets, including\nMedical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) and PubChem BioAssay\n(PCBA).",
