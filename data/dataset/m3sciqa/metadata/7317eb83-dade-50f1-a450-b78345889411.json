    "abstract": "Autoregressive decoding is the only part of sequence-to-sequence models that\nprevents them from massive parallelization at inference time.\nNon-autoregressive models enable the decoder to generate all output symbols\nindependently in parallel. We present a novel non-autoregressive architecture\nbased on connectionist temporal classification and evaluate it on the task of\nneural machine translation. Unlike other non-autoregressive methods which\noperate in several steps, our model can be trained end-to-end. We conduct\nexperiments on the WMT English-Romanian and English-German datasets. Our models\nachieve a significant speedup over the autoregressive models, keeping the\ntranslation quality comparable to other non-autoregressive models.",
