    "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding, which aims to represent entities and relations as\nlow dimensional vectors (or matrices, tensors, etc.), has been shown to be a\npowerful technique for predicting missing links in knowledge graphs. Existing\nknowledge graph embedding models mainly focus on modeling relation patterns\nsuch as symmetry/antisymmetry, inversion, and composition. However, many\nexisting approaches fail to model semantic hierarchies, which are common in\nreal-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nknowledge graph embedding model -- namely, Hierarchy-Aware Knowledge Graph\nEmbedding (HAKE) -- which maps entities into the polar coordinate system. HAKE\nis inspired by the fact that concentric circles in the polar coordinate system\ncan naturally reflect the hierarchy. Specifically, the radial coordinate aims\nto model entities at different levels of the hierarchy, and entities with\nsmaller radii are expected to be at higher levels; the angular coordinate aims\nto distinguish entities at the same level of the hierarchy, and these entities\nare expected to have roughly the same radii but different angles. Experiments\ndemonstrate that HAKE can effectively model the semantic hierarchies in\nknowledge graphs, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods on benchmark datasets for the link prediction task.",
