    "abstract": "State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set\nof predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits\ntheir generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to\nspecify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images\nis a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of\nsupervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting\nwhich caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn\nSOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image,\ntext) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language\nis used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling\nzero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance\nof this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision\ndatasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos,\ngeo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The\nmodel transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a\nfully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training.\nFor instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet\nzero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it\nwas trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at\nhttps://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP.",
