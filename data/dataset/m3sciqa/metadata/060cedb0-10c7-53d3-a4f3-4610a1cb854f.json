    "abstract": "Factual consistency is an essential quality of text summarization models in\npractical settings. Existing work in evaluating this dimension can be broadly\ncategorized into two lines of research, entailment-based and question answering\n(QA)-based metrics, and different experimental setups often lead to contrasting\nconclusions as to which paradigm performs the best. In this work, we conduct an\nextensive comparison of entailment and QA-based metrics, demonstrating that\ncarefully choosing the components of a QA-based metric, especially question\ngeneration and answerability classification, is critical to performance.\nBuilding on those insights, we propose an optimized metric, which we call\nQAFactEval, that leads to a 14% average improvement over previous QA-based\nmetrics on the SummaC factual consistency benchmark, and also outperforms the\nbest-performing entailment-based metric. Moreover, we find that QA-based and\nentailment-based metrics can offer complementary signals and be combined into a\nsingle metric for a further performance boost.",
