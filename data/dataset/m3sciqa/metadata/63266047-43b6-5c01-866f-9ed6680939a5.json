    "abstract": "Pre-trained models have proved to be powerful in enhancing task-oriented\ndialog systems. However, current pre-training methods mainly focus on enhancing\ndialog understanding and generation tasks while neglecting the exploitation of\ndialog policy. In this paper, we propose GALAXY, a novel pre-trained dialog\nmodel that explicitly learns dialog policy from limited labeled dialogs and\nlarge-scale unlabeled dialog corpora via semi-supervised learning.\nSpecifically, we introduce a dialog act prediction task for policy optimization\nduring pre-training and employ a consistency regularization term to refine the\nlearned representation with the help of unlabeled dialogs. We also implement a\ngating mechanism to weigh suitable unlabeled dialog samples. Empirical results\nshow that GALAXY substantially improves the performance of task-oriented dialog\nsystems, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets:\nIn-Car, MultiWOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1, improving their end-to-end combined scores\nby 2.5, 5.3 and 5.5 points, respectively. We also show that GALAXY has a\nstronger few-shot ability than existing models under various low-resource\nsettings.",
