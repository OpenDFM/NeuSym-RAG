    "abstract": "Persona can function as the prior knowledge for maintaining the consistency\nof dialogue systems. Most of previous studies adopted the self persona in\ndialogue whose response was about to be selected from a set of candidates or\ndirectly generated, but few have noticed the role of partner in dialogue. This\npaper makes an attempt to thoroughly explore the impact of utilizing personas\nthat describe either self or partner speakers on the task of response selection\nin retrieval-based chatbots. Four persona fusion strategies are designed, which\nassume personas interact with contexts or responses in different ways. These\nstrategies are implemented into three representative models for response\nselection, which are based on the Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder (HRE),\nInteractive Matching Network (IMN) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations\nfrom Transformers (BERT) respectively. Empirical studies on the Persona-Chat\ndataset show that the partner personas neglected in previous studies can\nimprove the accuracy of response selection in the IMN- and BERT-based models.\nBesides, our BERT-based model implemented with the context-response-aware\npersona fusion strategy outperforms previous methods by margins larger than\n2.7% on original personas and 4.6% on revised personas in terms of hits@1\n(top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nPersona-Chat dataset.",
