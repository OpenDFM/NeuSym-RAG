    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of political bias in news media calls for greater\npublic awareness of it, as well as robust methods for its detection. While\nprior work in NLP has primarily focused on the lexical bias captured by\nlinguistic attributes such as word choice and syntax, other types of bias stem\nfrom the actual content selected for inclusion in the text. In this work, we\ninvestigate the effects of informational bias: factual content that can\nnevertheless be deployed to sway reader opinion. We first produce a new\ndataset, BASIL, of 300 news articles annotated with 1,727 bias spans and find\nevidence that informational bias appears in news articles more frequently than\nlexical bias. We further study our annotations to observe how informational\nbias surfaces in news articles by different media outlets. Lastly, a baseline\nmodel for informational bias prediction is presented by fine-tuning BERT on our\nlabeled data, indicating the challenges of the task and future directions.",
