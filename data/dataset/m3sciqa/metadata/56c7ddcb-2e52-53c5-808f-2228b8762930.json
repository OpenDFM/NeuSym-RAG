    "abstract": "Implicit discourse relation recognition is a challenging task that involves\nidentifying the sense or senses that hold between two adjacent spans of text,\nin the absence of an explicit connective between them. In both PDTB-2 and\nPDTB-3, discourse relational senses are organized into a three-level hierarchy\nranging from four broad top-level senses, to more specific senses below them.\nMost previous work on implicit discourse relation recognition have used the\nsense hierarchy simply to indicate what sense labels were available. Here we do\nmore -- incorporating the sense hierarchy into the recognition process itself\nand using it to select the negative examples used in contrastive learning. With\nno additional effort, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\ntask.",
