    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is essential in many real-world applications such as\nstance detection, review analysis, recommendation system, and so on. Sentiment\nanalysis becomes more difficult when the data is noisy and collected from\nsocial media. India is a multilingual country; people use more than one\nlanguages to communicate within themselves. The switching in between the\nlanguages is called code-switching or code-mixing, depending upon the type of\nmixing. This paper presents overview of the shared task on sentiment analysis\nof code-mixed data pairs of Hindi-English and Bengali-English collected from\nthe different social media platform. The paper describes the task, dataset,\nevaluation, baseline and participant's systems.",
