    "abstract": "Solving complicated AI tasks with different domains and modalities is a key\nstep toward artificial general intelligence. While there are numerous AI models\navailable for various domains and modalities, they cannot handle complicated AI\ntasks autonomously. Considering large language models (LLMs) have exhibited\nexceptional abilities in language understanding, generation, interaction, and\nreasoning, we advocate that LLMs could act as a controller to manage existing\nAI models to solve complicated AI tasks, with language serving as a generic\ninterface to empower this. Based on this philosophy, we present HuggingGPT, an\nLLM-powered agent that leverages LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) to connect various AI\nmodels in machine learning communities (e.g., Hugging Face) to solve AI tasks.\nSpecifically, we use ChatGPT to conduct task planning when receiving a user\nrequest, select models according to their function descriptions available in\nHugging Face, execute each subtask with the selected AI model, and summarize\nthe response according to the execution results. By leveraging the strong\nlanguage capability of ChatGPT and abundant AI models in Hugging Face,\nHuggingGPT can tackle a wide range of sophisticated AI tasks spanning different\nmodalities and domains and achieve impressive results in language, vision,\nspeech, and other challenging tasks, which paves a new way towards the\nrealization of artificial general intelligence.",
