    "abstract": "Currently used metrics for assessing summarization algorithms do not account\nfor whether summaries are factually consistent with source documents. We\npropose a weakly-supervised, model-based approach for verifying factual\nconsistency and identifying conflicts between source documents and a generated\nsummary. Training data is generated by applying a series of rule-based\ntransformations to the sentences of source documents. The factual consistency\nmodel is then trained jointly for three tasks: 1) identify whether sentences\nremain factually consistent after transformation, 2) extract a span in the\nsource documents to support the consistency prediction, 3) extract a span in\nthe summary sentence that is inconsistent if one exists. Transferring this\nmodel to summaries generated by several state-of-the art models reveals that\nthis highly scalable approach substantially outperforms previous models,\nincluding those trained with strong supervision using standard datasets for\nnatural language inference and fact checking. Additionally, human evaluation\nshows that the auxiliary span extraction tasks provide useful assistance in the\nprocess of verifying factual consistency.",
