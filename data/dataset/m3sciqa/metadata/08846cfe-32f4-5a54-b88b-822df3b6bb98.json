    "abstract": "While there exist scores of natural languages, each with its unique features\nand idiosyncrasies, they all share a unifying theme: enabling human\ncommunication. We may thus reasonably predict that human cognition shapes how\nthese languages evolve and are used. Assuming that the capacity to process\ninformation is roughly constant across human populations, we expect a\nsurprisal--duration trade-off to arise both across and within languages. We\nanalyse this trade-off using a corpus of 600 languages and, after controlling\nfor several potential confounds, we find strong supporting evidence in both\nsettings. Specifically, we find that, on average, phones are produced faster in\nlanguages where they are less surprising, and vice versa. Further, we confirm\nthat more surprising phones are longer, on average, in 319 languages out of the\n600. We thus conclude that there is strong evidence of a surprisal--duration\ntrade-off in operation, both across and within the world's languages.",
