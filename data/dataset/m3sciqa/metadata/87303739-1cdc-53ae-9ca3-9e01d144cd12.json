    "abstract": "We present a simple method to incorporate syntactic information about the\ntarget language in a neural machine translation system by translating into\nlinearized, lexicalized constituency trees. An experiment on the WMT16\nGerman-English news translation task resulted in an improved BLEU score when\ncompared to a syntax-agnostic NMT baseline trained on the same dataset. An\nanalysis of the translations from the syntax-aware system shows that it\nperforms more reordering during translation in comparison to the baseline. A\nsmall-scale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware\nsystem.",
