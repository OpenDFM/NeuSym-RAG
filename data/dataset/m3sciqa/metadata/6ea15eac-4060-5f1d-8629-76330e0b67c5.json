    "abstract": "While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for\nnatural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain\nlimited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with\nconvolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional\nnetworks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this\nreliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to\nsequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks.\nWhen pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized\nor small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision\nTransformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art\nconvolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational\nresources to train.",
