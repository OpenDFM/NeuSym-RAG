    "abstract": "The goal of text generation is to make machines express in human language. It\nis one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language\nprocessing (NLP). Since 2014, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered\nby Seq2Seq have been proposed to achieve the goal by learning to map input text\nto output text. However, the input text alone often provides limited knowledge\nto generate the desired output, so the performance of text generation is still\nfar from satisfaction in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue,\nresearchers have considered incorporating various forms of knowledge beyond the\ninput text into the generation models. This research direction is known as\nknowledge-enhanced text generation. In this survey, we present a comprehensive\nreview of the research on knowledge enhanced text generation over the past five\nyears. The main content includes two parts: (i) general methods and\narchitectures for integrating knowledge into text generation; (ii) specific\ntechniques and applications according to different forms of knowledge data.\nThis survey can have broad audiences, researchers and practitioners, in\nacademia and industry.",
