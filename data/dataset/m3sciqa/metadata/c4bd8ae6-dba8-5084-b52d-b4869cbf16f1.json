    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves\nin the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to\ntheir emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box\nmodels, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In\ncontrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are\nstructured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs\ncan enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and\ninterpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by\nnature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and\nrepresent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and\nKGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we\npresent a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our\nroadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs,\nwhich incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or\nfor the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2)\nLLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding,\ncompletion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and\n3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a\nmutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional\nreasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing\nefforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future\nresearch directions.",
