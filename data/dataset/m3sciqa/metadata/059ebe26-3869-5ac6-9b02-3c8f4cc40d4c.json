    "abstract": "The goal of information-seeking dialogue is to respond to seeker queries with\nnatural language utterances that are grounded on knowledge sources. However,\ndialogue systems often produce unsupported utterances, a phenomenon known as\nhallucination. To mitigate this behavior, we adopt a data-centric solution and\ncreate FaithDial, a new benchmark for hallucination-free dialogues, by editing\nhallucinated responses in the Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW) benchmark. We observe\nthat FaithDial is more faithful than WoW while also maintaining engaging\nconversations. We show that FaithDial can serve as training signal for: i) a\nhallucination critic, which discriminates whether an utterance is faithful or\nnot, and boosts the performance by 12.8 F1 score on the BEGIN benchmark\ncompared to existing datasets for dialogue coherence; ii) high-quality dialogue\ngeneration. We benchmark a series of state-of-the-art models and propose an\nauxiliary contrastive objective that achieves the highest level of faithfulness\nand abstractiveness based on several automated metrics. Further, we find that\nthe benefits of FaithDial generalize to zero-shot transfer on other datasets,\nsuch as CMU-Dog and TopicalChat. Finally, human evaluation reveals that\nresponses generated by models trained on FaithDial are perceived as more\ninterpretable, cooperative, and engaging.",
