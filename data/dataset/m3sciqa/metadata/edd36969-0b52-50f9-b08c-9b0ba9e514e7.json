    "abstract": "Document and discourse segmentation are two fundamental NLP tasks pertaining\nto breaking up text into constituents, which are commonly used to help\ndownstream tasks such as information retrieval or text summarization. In this\nwork, we propose three transformer-based architectures and provide\ncomprehensive comparisons with previously proposed approaches on three standard\ndatasets. We establish a new state-of-the-art, reducing in particular the error\nrates by a large margin in all cases. We further analyze model sizes and find\nthat we can build models with many fewer parameters while keeping good\nperformance, thus facilitating real-world applications.",
