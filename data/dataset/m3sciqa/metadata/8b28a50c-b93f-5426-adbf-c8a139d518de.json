    "abstract": "Personalized response selection systems are generally grounded on persona.\nHowever, there exists a co-relation between persona and empathy, which is not\nexplored well in these systems. Also, faithfulness to the conversation context\nplunges when a contradictory or an off-topic response is selected. This paper\nattempts to address these issues by proposing a suite of fusion strategies that\ncapture the interaction between persona, emotion, and entailment information of\nthe utterances. Ablation studies on the Persona-Chat dataset show that\nincorporating emotion and entailment improves the accuracy of response\nselection. We combine our fusion strategies and concept-flow encoding to train\na BERT-based model which outperforms the previous methods by margins larger\nthan 2.3 % on original personas and 1.9 % on revised personas in terms of\nhits@1 (top-1 accuracy), achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the\nPersona-Chat dataset.",
