    "abstract": "Most studies on abstractive summarization report ROUGE scores between system\nand reference summaries. However, we have a concern about the truthfulness of\ngenerated summaries: whether all facts of a generated summary are mentioned in\nthe source text. This paper explores improving the truthfulness in headline\ngeneration on two popular datasets. Analyzing headlines generated by the\nstate-of-the-art encoder-decoder model, we show that the model sometimes\ngenerates untruthful headlines. We conjecture that one of the reasons lies in\nuntruthful supervision data used for training the model. In order to quantify\nthe truthfulness of article-headline pairs, we consider the textual entailment\nof whether an article entails its headline. After confirming quite a few\nuntruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing\nuntruthful instances from the supervision data may remedy the problem of the\nuntruthful behaviors of the model. Building a binary classifier that predicts\nan entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out\nuntruthful instances from the supervision data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the headline generation model trained on filtered supervision\ndata shows no clear difference in ROUGE scores but remarkable improvements in\nautomatic and manual evaluations of the generated headlines.",
