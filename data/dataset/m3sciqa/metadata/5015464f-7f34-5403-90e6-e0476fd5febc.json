    "abstract": "There have been a lot of interest in the scaling properties of Transformer\nmodels. However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the\neffect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model\narchitectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does\ninductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream\n(pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study\nof scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers,\nSwitch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers,\nand recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1)\narchitecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling\nand (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales. We believe\nthat the findings outlined in this work has significant implications to how\nmodel architectures are currently evaluated in the community.",
