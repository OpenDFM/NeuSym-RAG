    "abstract": "Despite tremendous improvements in natural language generation, summarization\nmodels still suffer from the unfaithfulness issue. Previous work evaluates\nfaithfulness either using models trained on the other tasks or in-domain\nsynthetic data, or prompting a large model such as ChatGPT. This paper proposes\nto do zero-shot faithfulness evaluation simply with a moderately-sized\nfoundation language model. We introduce a new metric FFLM, which is a\ncombination of probability changes based on the intuition that prefixing a\npiece of text that is consistent with the output will increase the probability\nof predicting the output. Experiments show that FFLM performs competitively\nwith or even outperforms ChatGPT on both inconsistency detection and\nfaithfulness rating with 24x fewer parameters. FFLM also achieves improvements\nover other strong baselines.",
