    "abstract": "The reviews of customers play an essential role in online shopping. People\noften refer to reviews or comments of previous customers to decide whether to\nbuy a new product. Catching up with this behavior, some people create untruths\nand illegitimate reviews to hoax customers about the fake quality of products.\nThese are called spam reviews, confusing consumers on online shopping platforms\nand negatively affecting online shopping behaviors. We propose the dataset\ncalled ViSpamReviews, which has a strict annotation procedure for detecting\nspam reviews on e-commerce platforms. Our dataset consists of two tasks: the\nbinary classification task for detecting whether a review is spam or not and\nthe multi-class classification task for identifying the type of spam. The\nPhoBERT obtained the highest results on both tasks, 86.89% and 72.17%,\nrespectively, by macro average F1 score.",
