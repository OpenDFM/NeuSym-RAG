    "abstract": "The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems\nin variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ\nsimple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient\ninference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations.\nThis restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made\nusing variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible,\narbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our\napproximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow,\nwhereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by\napplying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of\ncomplexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop\ncategories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of\napproaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that\nthe theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true\nposterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches,\nprovides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational\ninference.",
