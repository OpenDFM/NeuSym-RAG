    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to interact with\nexternal environments (e.g., games, compilers, APIs) as goal-driven agents.\nHowever, it remains challenging for these language agents to quickly and\nefficiently learn from trial-and-error as traditional reinforcement learning\nmethods require extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning. We\npropose Reflexion, a novel framework to reinforce language agents not by\nupdating weights, but instead through linguistic feedback. Concretely,\nReflexion agents verbally reflect on task feedback signals, then maintain their\nown reflective text in an episodic memory buffer to induce better\ndecision-making in subsequent trials. Reflexion is flexible enough to\nincorporate various types (scalar values or free-form language) and sources\n(external or internally simulated) of feedback signals, and obtains significant\nimprovements over a baseline agent across diverse tasks (sequential\ndecision-making, coding, language reasoning). For example, Reflexion achieves a\n91% pass@1 accuracy on the HumanEval coding benchmark, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art GPT-4 that achieves 80%. We also conduct ablation and analysis\nstudies using different feedback signals, feedback incorporation methods, and\nagent types, and provide insights into how they affect performance.",
