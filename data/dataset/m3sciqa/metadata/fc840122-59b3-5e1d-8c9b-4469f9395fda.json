    "abstract": "Medical imaging is frequently used in clinical practice and trials for\ndiagnosis and treatment. Writing imaging reports is time-consuming and can be\nerror-prone for inexperienced radiologists. Therefore, automatically generating\nradiology reports is highly desired to lighten the workload of radiologists and\naccordingly promote clinical automation, which is an essential task to apply\nartificial intelligence to the medical domain. In this paper, we propose to\ngenerate radiology reports with memory-driven Transformer, where a relational\nmemory is designed to record key information of the generation process and a\nmemory-driven conditional layer normalization is applied to incorporating the\nmemory into the decoder of Transformer. Experimental results on two prevailing\nradiology report datasets, IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR, show that our proposed\napproach outperforms previous models with respect to both language generation\nmetrics and clinical evaluations. Particularly, this is the first work\nreporting the generation results on MIMIC-CXR to the best of our knowledge.\nFurther analyses also demonstrate that our approach is able to generate long\nreports with necessary medical terms as well as meaningful image-text attention\nmappings.",
