    "abstract": "An emerging method to cheaply improve a weaker language model is to finetune\nit on outputs from a stronger model, such as a proprietary system like ChatGPT\n(e.g., Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and others). This approach looks to cheaply\nimitate the proprietary model's capabilities using a weaker open-source model.\nIn this work, we critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series\nof LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data\nsources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the\nmodels using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were\nsurprised by the output quality of our imitation models -- they appear far\nbetter at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as\ncompetitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic\nevaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from\nthe base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation\ndata. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters\nbecause imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT's style but not its\nfactuality. Overall, we conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there\nexists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that, with\ncurrent methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data\nor by using more capable base LMs. In turn, we argue that the highest leverage\naction for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of\ndeveloping better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating\nproprietary systems.",
