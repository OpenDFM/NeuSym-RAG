    "abstract": "We present the first provably sublinear time algorithm for approximate\n\\emph{Maximum Inner Product Search} (MIPS). Our proposal is also the first\nhashing algorithm for searching with (un-normalized) inner product as the\nunderlying similarity measure. Finding hashing schemes for MIPS was considered\nhard. We formally show that the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)\nframework is insufficient for solving MIPS, and then we extend the existing LSH\nframework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on an\ninteresting mathematical phenomenon in which inner products, after independent\nasymmetric transformations, can be converted into the problem of approximate\nnear neighbor search. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing\nscheme for MIPS possible. In the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework, we\nprovide an explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. The\nproposed construction and the extended LSH framework could be of independent\ntheoretical interest. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement.\nWe evaluate the method, for retrieving inner products, in the collaborative\nfiltering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens datasets.",
