    "abstract": "Intimacy is a fundamental aspect of how we relate to others in social\nsettings. Language encodes the social information of intimacy through both\ntopics and other more subtle cues (such as linguistic hedging and swearing).\nHere, we introduce a new computational framework for studying expressions of\nthe intimacy in language with an accompanying dataset and deep learning model\nfor accurately predicting the intimacy level of questions (Pearson's r=0.87).\nThrough analyzing a dataset of 80.5M questions across social media, books, and\nfilms, we show that individuals employ interpersonal pragmatic moves in their\nlanguage to align their intimacy with social settings. Then, in three studies,\nwe further demonstrate how individuals modulate their intimacy to match social\nnorms around gender, social distance, and audience, each validating key\nfindings from studies in social psychology. Our work demonstrates that intimacy\nis a pervasive and impactful social dimension of language.",
