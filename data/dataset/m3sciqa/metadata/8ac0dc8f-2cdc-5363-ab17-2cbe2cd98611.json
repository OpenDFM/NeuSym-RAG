    "abstract": "Detecting rumors on social media is a very critical task with significant\nimplications to the economy, public health, etc. Previous works generally\ncapture effective features from texts and the propagation structure. However,\nthe uncertainty caused by unreliable relations in the propagation structure is\ncommon and inevitable due to wily rumor producers and the limited collection of\nspread data. Most approaches neglect it and may seriously limit the learning of\nfeatures. Towards this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to explore\npropagation uncertainty for rumor detection. Specifically, we propose a novel\nEdge-enhanced Bayesian Graph Convolutional Network (EBGCN) to capture robust\nstructural features. The model adaptively rethinks the reliability of latent\nrelations by adopting a Bayesian approach. Besides, we design a new edge-wise\nconsistency training framework to optimize the model by enforcing consistency\non relations. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nthe proposed model achieves better performance than baseline methods on both\nrumor detection and early rumor detection tasks.",
