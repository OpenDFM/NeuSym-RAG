    "abstract": "Developing automatic Math Word Problem (MWP) solvers has been an interest of\nNLP researchers since the 1960s. Over the last few years, there are a growing\nnumber of datasets and deep learning-based methods proposed for effectively\nsolving MWPs. However, most existing methods are benchmarked soly on one or two\ndatasets, varying in different configurations, which leads to a lack of\nunified, standardized, fair, and comprehensive comparison between methods. This\npaper presents MWPToolkit, the first open-source framework for solving MWPs. In\nMWPToolkit, we decompose the procedure of existing MWP solvers into multiple\ncore components and decouple their models into highly reusable modules. We also\nprovide a hyper-parameter search function to boost the performance. In total,\nwe implement and compare 17 MWP solvers on 4 widely-used single equation\ngeneration benchmarks and 2 multiple equations generation benchmarks. These\nfeatures enable our MWPToolkit to be suitable for researchers to reproduce\nadvanced baseline models and develop new MWP solvers quickly.
