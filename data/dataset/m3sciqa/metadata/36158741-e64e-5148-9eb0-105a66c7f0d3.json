    "abstract": "In this work, we consider the problem of imbalanced data in a regression\nframework when the imbalanced phenomenon concerns continuous or discrete\ncovariates. Such a situation can lead to biases in the estimates. In this case,\nwe propose a data augmentation algorithm that combines a weighted resampling\n(WR) and a data augmentation (DA) procedure. In a first step, the DA procedure\npermits exploring a wider support than the initial one. In a second step, the\nWR method drives the exogenous distribution to a target one. We discuss the\nchoice of the DA procedure through a numerical study that illustrates the\nadvantages of this approach. Finally, an actuarial application is studied.",
