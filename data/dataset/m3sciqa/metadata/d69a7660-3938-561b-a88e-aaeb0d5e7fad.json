    "abstract": "Human knowledge provides a formal understanding of the world. Knowledge\ngraphs that represent structural relations between entities have become an\nincreasingly popular research direction towards cognition and human-level\nintelligence. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of knowledge\ngraph covering overall research topics about 1) knowledge graph representation\nlearning, 2) knowledge acquisition and completion, 3) temporal knowledge graph,\nand 4) knowledge-aware applications, and summarize recent breakthroughs and\nperspective directions to facilitate future research. We propose a full-view\ncategorization and new taxonomies on these topics. Knowledge graph embedding is\norganized from four aspects of representation space, scoring function, encoding\nmodels, and auxiliary information. For knowledge acquisition, especially\nknowledge graph completion, embedding methods, path inference, and logical rule\nreasoning, are reviewed. We further explore several emerging topics, including\nmeta relational learning, commonsense reasoning, and temporal knowledge graphs.\nTo facilitate future research on knowledge graphs, we also provide a curated\ncollection of datasets and open-source libraries on different tasks. In the\nend, we have a thorough outlook on several promising research directions.",
