    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative language models has brought about\nsubstantial advancements in digital communication, while simultaneously raising\nconcerns regarding the potential misuse of AI-generated content. Although\nnumerous detection methods have been proposed to differentiate between AI and\nhuman-generated content, the fairness and robustness of these detectors remain\nunderexplored. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several\nwidely-used GPT detectors using writing samples from native and non-native\nEnglish writers. Our findings reveal that these detectors consistently\nmisclassify non-native English writing samples as AI-generated, whereas native\nwriting samples are accurately identified. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nsimple prompting strategies can not only mitigate this bias but also\neffectively bypass GPT detectors, suggesting that GPT detectors may\nunintentionally penalize writers with constrained linguistic expressions. Our\nresults call for a broader conversation about the ethical implications of\ndeploying ChatGPT content detectors and caution against their use in evaluative\nor educational settings, particularly when they may inadvertently penalize or\nexclude non-native English speakers from the global discourse.
