    "abstract": "The discovery of novel materials and functional molecules can help to solve\nsome of society's most urgent challenges, ranging from efficient energy\nharvesting and storage to uncovering novel pharmaceutical drug candidates.\nTraditionally matter engineering -- generally denoted as inverse design -- was\nbased massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual screening. The\nlast few years have seen the emergence of significant interest in\ncomputer-inspired designs based on evolutionary or deep learning methods. The\nmajor challenge here is that the standard strings molecular representation\nSMILES shows substantial weaknesses in that task because large fractions of\nstrings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here, we solve this problem at a\nfundamental level and introduce SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings), a\nstring-based representation of molecules which is 100\\% robust. Every SELFIES\nstring corresponds to a valid molecule, and SELFIES can represent every\nmolecule. SELFIES can be directly applied in arbitrary machine learning models\nwithout the adaptation of the models; each of the generated molecule candidates\nis valid. In our experiments, the model's internal memory stores two orders of\nmagnitude more diverse molecules than a similar test with SMILES. Furthermore,\nas all molecules are valid, it allows for explanation and interpretation of the\ninternal working of the generative models.",
