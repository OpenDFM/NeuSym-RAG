    "abstract": "We introduce the Neural State Machine, seeking to bridge the gap between the\nneural and symbolic views of AI and integrate their complementary strengths for\nthe task of visual reasoning. Given an image, we first predict a probabilistic\ngraph that represents its underlying semantics and serves as a structured world\nmodel. Then, we perform sequential reasoning over the graph, iteratively\ntraversing its nodes to answer a given question or draw a new inference. In\ncontrast to most neural architectures that are designed to closely interact\nwith the raw sensory data, our model operates instead in an abstract latent\nspace, by transforming both the visual and linguistic modalities into semantic\nconcept-based representations, thereby achieving enhanced transparency and\nmodularity. We evaluate our model on VQA-CP and GQA, two recent VQA datasets\nthat involve compositionality, multi-step inference and diverse reasoning\nskills, achieving state-of-the-art results in both cases. We provide further\nexperiments that illustrate the model's strong generalization capacity across\nmultiple dimensions, including novel compositions of concepts, changes in the\nanswer distribution, and unseen linguistic structures, demonstrating the\nqualities and efficacy of our approach.",
