    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a bilingual parallel human-to-human recommendation\ndialog dataset (DuRecDial 2.0) to enable researchers to explore a challenging\ntask of multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation. The\ndifference between DuRecDial 2.0 and existing conversational recommendation\ndatasets is that the data item (Profile, Goal, Knowledge, Context, Response) in\nDuRecDial 2.0 is annotated in two languages, both English and Chinese, while\nother datasets are built with the setting of a single language. We collect 8.2k\ndialogs aligned across English and Chinese languages (16.5k dialogs and 255k\nutterances in total) that are annotated by crowdsourced workers with strict\nquality control procedure. We then build monolingual, multilingual, and\ncross-lingual conversational recommendation baselines on DuRecDial 2.0.\nExperiment results show that the use of additional English data can bring\nperformance improvement for Chinese conversational recommendation, indicating\nthe benefits of DuRecDial 2.0. Finally, this dataset provides a challenging\ntestbed for future studies of monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual\nconversational recommendation.",
