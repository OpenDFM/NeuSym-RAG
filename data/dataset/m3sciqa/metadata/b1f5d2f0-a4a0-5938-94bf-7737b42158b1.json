    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on\nmany Natural Language Processing (NLP) benchmarks. With the growing number of\nnew benchmarks, we build bigger and more complex LMs. However, building new LMs\nmay not be an ideal option owing to the cost, time and environmental impact\nassociated with it. We explore an alternative route: can we modify data by\nexpressing it in terms of the model's strengths, so that a question becomes\neasier for models to answer? We investigate if humans can decompose a hard\nquestion into a set of simpler questions that are relatively easier for models\nto solve. We analyze a range of datasets involving various forms of reasoning\nand find that it is indeed possible to significantly improve model performance\n(24% for GPT3 and 29% for RoBERTa-SQuAD along with a symbolic calculator) via\ndecomposition. Our approach provides a viable option to involve people in NLP\nresearch in a meaningful way. Our findings indicate that Human-in-the-loop\nQuestion Decomposition (HQD) can potentially provide an alternate path to\nbuilding large LMs. Code and data is available at\nhttps://github.com/Pruthvi98/QuestionDecomposition",
