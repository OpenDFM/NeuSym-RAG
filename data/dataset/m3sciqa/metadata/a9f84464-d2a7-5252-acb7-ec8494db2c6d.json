    "abstract": "Link prediction is a very fundamental task on graphs. Inspired by traditional\npath-based methods, in this paper we propose a general and flexible\nrepresentation learning framework based on paths for link prediction.\nSpecifically, we define the representation of a pair of nodes as the\ngeneralized sum of all path representations, with each path representation as\nthe generalized product of the edge representations in the path. Motivated by\nthe Bellman-Ford algorithm for solving the shortest path problem, we show that\nthe proposed path formulation can be efficiently solved by the generalized\nBellman-Ford algorithm. To further improve the capacity of the path\nformulation, we propose the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), a general\ngraph neural network framework that solves the path formulation with learned\noperators in the generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. The NBFNet parameterizes\nthe generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm with 3 neural components, namely\nINDICATOR, MESSAGE and AGGREGATE functions, which corresponds to the boundary\ncondition, multiplication operator, and summation operator respectively. The\nNBFNet is very general, covers many traditional path-based methods, and can be\napplied to both homogeneous graphs and multi-relational graphs (e.g., knowledge\ngraphs) in both transductive and inductive settings. Experiments on both\nhomogeneous graphs and knowledge graphs show that the proposed NBFNet\noutperforms existing methods by a large margin in both transductive and\ninductive settings, achieving new state-of-the-art results.",
