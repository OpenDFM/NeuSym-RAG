    "abstract": "Following each patient visit, physicians draft long semi-structured clinical\nsummaries called SOAP notes. While invaluable to clinicians and researchers,\ncreating digital SOAP notes is burdensome, contributing to physician burnout.\nIn this paper, we introduce the first complete pipelines to leverage deep\nsummarization models to generate these notes based on transcripts of\nconversations between physicians and patients. After exploring a spectrum of\nmethods across the extractive-abstractive spectrum, we propose Cluster2Sent, an\nalgorithm that (i) extracts important utterances relevant to each summary\nsection; (ii) clusters together related utterances; and then (iii) generates\none summary sentence per cluster. Cluster2Sent outperforms its purely\nabstractive counterpart by 8 ROUGE-1 points, and produces significantly more\nfactual and coherent sentences as assessed by expert human evaluators. For\nreproducibility, we demonstrate similar benefits on the publicly available AMI\ndataset. Our results speak to the benefits of structuring summaries into\nsections and annotating supporting evidence when constructing summarization\ncorpora.",
