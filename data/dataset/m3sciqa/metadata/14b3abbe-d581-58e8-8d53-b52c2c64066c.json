    "abstract": "Question answering requiring discrete reasoning, e.g., arithmetic computing,\ncomparison, and counting, over knowledge is a challenging task. In this paper,\nwe propose UniRPG, a semantic-parsing-based approach advanced in\ninterpretability and scalability, to perform unified discrete reasoning over\nheterogeneous knowledge resources, i.e., table and text, as program generation.\nConcretely, UniRPG consists of a neural programmer and a symbolic program\nexecutor, where a program is the composition of a set of pre-defined general\natomic and higher-order operations and arguments extracted from table and text.\nFirst, the programmer parses a question into a program by generating operations\nand copying arguments, and then the executor derives answers from table and\ntext based on the program. To alleviate the costly program annotation issue, we\ndesign a distant supervision approach for programmer learning, where pseudo\nprograms are automatically constructed without annotated derivations. Extensive\nexperiments on the TAT-QA dataset show that UniRPG achieves tremendous\nimprovements and enhances interpretability and scalability compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods, even without derivation annotation. Moreover, it\nachieves promising performance on the textual dataset DROP without derivations.",
