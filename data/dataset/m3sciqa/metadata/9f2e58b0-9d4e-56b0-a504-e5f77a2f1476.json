    "abstract": "Our work addresses the critical issue of distinguishing text generated by\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) from human-produced text, a task essential for\nnumerous applications. Despite ongoing debate about the feasibility of such\ndifferentiation, we present evidence supporting its consistent achievability,\nexcept when human and machine text distributions are indistinguishable across\ntheir entire support. Drawing from information theory, we argue that as\nmachine-generated text approximates human-like quality, the sample size needed\nfor detection increases. We establish precise sample complexity bounds for\ndetecting AI-generated text, laying groundwork for future research aimed at\ndeveloping advanced, multi-sample detectors. Our empirical evaluations across\nmultiple datasets (Xsum, Squad, IMDb, and Kaggle FakeNews) confirm the\nviability of enhanced detection methods. We test various state-of-the-art text\ngenerators, including GPT-2, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama, Llama-2-13B-Chat-HF, and\nLlama-2-70B-Chat-HF, against detectors, including oBERTa-Large/Base-Detector,\nGPTZero. Our findings align with OpenAI's empirical data related to sequence\nlength, marking the first theoretical substantiation for these observations.",
