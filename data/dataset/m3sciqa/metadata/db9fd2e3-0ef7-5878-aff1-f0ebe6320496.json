    "abstract": "We address the rating-inference problem, wherein rather than simply decide\nwhether a review is \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\", as in previous sentiment\nanalysis work, one must determine an author's evaluation with respect to a\nmulti-point scale (e.g., one to five \"stars\"). This task represents an\ninteresting twist on standard multi-class text categorization because there are\nseveral different degrees of similarity between class labels; for example,\n\"three stars\" is intuitively closer to \"four stars\" than to \"one star\". We\nfirst evaluate human performance at the task. Then, we apply a meta-algorithm,\nbased on a metric labeling formulation of the problem, that alters a given\nn-ary classifier's output in an explicit attempt to ensure that similar items\nreceive similar labels. We show that the meta-algorithm can provide significant\nimprovements over both multi-class and regression versions of SVMs when we\nemploy a novel similarity measure appropriate to the problem.",
