    "abstract": "Existing MWP solvers employ sequence or binary tree to present the solution\nexpression and decode it from given problem description. However, such\nstructures fail to handle the variants that can be derived via mathematical\nmanipulation, e.g., $(a_1+a_2) * a_3$ and $a_1 * a_3+a_2 * a_3$ can both be\npossible valid solutions for a same problem but formulated as different\nexpression sequences or trees. The multiple solution variants depicting\ndifferent possible solving procedures for the same input problem would raise\ntwo issues: 1) making it hard for the model to learn the mapping function\nbetween the input and output spaces effectively, and 2) wrongly indicating\n\\textit{wrong} when evaluating a valid expression variant. To address these\nissues, we introduce a unified tree structure to present a solution expression,\nwhere the elements are permutable and identical for all the expression\nvariants. We propose a novel non-autoregressive solver, named \\textit{MWP-NAS},\nto parse the problem and deduce the solution expression based on the unified\ntree. For evaluating the possible expression variants, we design a path-based\nmetric to evaluate the partial accuracy of expressions of a unified tree. The\nresults from extensive experiments conducted on Math23K and MAWPS demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed MWP-NAS. The codes and checkpoints are\navailable at: \\url{https://github.com/mengqunhan/MWP-NAS}.",
