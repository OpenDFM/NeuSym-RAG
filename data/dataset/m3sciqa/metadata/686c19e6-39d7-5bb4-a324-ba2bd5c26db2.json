    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider mimicking fictional characters as a promising\ndirection for building engaging conversation models. To this end, we present a\nnew practical task where only a few utterances of each fictional character are\navailable to generate responses mimicking them. Furthermore, we propose a new\nmethod named Pseudo Dialog Prompting (PDP) that generates responses by\nleveraging the power of large-scale language models with prompts containing the\ntarget character's utterances. To better reflect the style of the character,\nPDP builds the prompts in the form of dialog that includes the character's\nutterances as dialog history. Since only utterances of the characters are\navailable in the proposed task, PDP matches each utterance with an appropriate\npseudo-context from a predefined set of context candidates using a retrieval\nmodel. Through human and automatic evaluation, we show that PDP generates\nresponses that better reflect the style of fictional characters than baseline\nmethods.",
