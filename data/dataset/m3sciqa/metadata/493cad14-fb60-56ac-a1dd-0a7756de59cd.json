    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue is often decomposed into three tasks: understanding\nuser input, deciding actions, and generating a response. While such\ndecomposition might suggest a dedicated model for each sub-task, we find a\nsimple, unified approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on the MultiWOZ\ndataset. SimpleTOD is a simple approach to task-oriented dialogue that uses a\nsingle, causal language model trained on all sub-tasks recast as a single\nsequence prediction problem. This allows SimpleTOD to fully leverage transfer\nlearning from pre-trained, open domain, causal language models such as GPT-2.\nSimpleTOD improves over the prior state-of-the-art in joint goal accuracy for\ndialogue state tracking, and our analysis reveals robustness to noisy\nannotations in this setting. SimpleTOD also improves the main metrics used to\nevaluate action decisions and response generation in an end-to-end setting:\ninform rate by 8.1 points, success rate by 9.7 points, and combined score by\n7.2 points.",
