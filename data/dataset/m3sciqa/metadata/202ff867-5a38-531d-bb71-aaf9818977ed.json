    "abstract": "Goal-directed dialogue systems aim to proactively reach a pre-determined\ntarget through multi-turn conversations. The key to achieving this task lies in\nplanning dialogue paths that smoothly and coherently direct conversations\ntowards the target. However, this is a challenging and under-explored task. In\nthis work, we propose a coherent dialogue planning approach that uses a\nstochastic process to model the temporal dynamics of dialogue paths. We define\na latent space that captures the coherence of goal-directed behavior using a\nBrownian bridge process, which allows us to incorporate user feedback flexibly\nin dialogue planning. Based on the derived latent trajectories, we generate\ndialogue paths explicitly using pre-trained language models. We finally employ\nthese paths as natural language prompts to guide dialogue generation. Our\nexperiments show that our approach generates more coherent utterances and\nachieves the goal with a higher success rate.",
