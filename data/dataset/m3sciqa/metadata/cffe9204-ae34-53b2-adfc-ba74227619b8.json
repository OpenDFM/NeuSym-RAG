    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is highly sensitive to sentential syntactic\nand semantic properties where entities may be extracted according to how they\nare used and placed in the running text. To model such properties, one could\nrely on existing resources to providing helpful knowledge to the NER task; some\nexisting studies proved the effectiveness of doing so, and yet are limited in\nappropriately leveraging the knowledge such as distinguishing the important\nones for particular context. In this paper, we improve NER by leveraging\ndifferent types of syntactic information through attentive ensemble, which\nfunctionalizes by the proposed key-value memory networks, syntax attention, and\nthe gate mechanism for encoding, weighting and aggregating such syntactic\ninformation, respectively. Experimental results on six English and Chinese\nbenchmark datasets suggest the effectiveness of the proposed model and show\nthat it outperforms previous studies on all experiment datasets.",
