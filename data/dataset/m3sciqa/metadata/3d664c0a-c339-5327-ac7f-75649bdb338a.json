    "abstract": "Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems have become crucial components in\ninteractive artificial intelligence applications. While recent advances have\ncapitalized on pre-trained language models (PLMs), they exhibit limitations\nregarding transparency and controllability. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel approach focusing on inferring the TOD-Flow graph from dialogue\ndata annotated with dialog acts, uncovering the underlying task structure in\nthe form of a graph. The inferred TOD-Flow graph can be easily integrated with\nany dialogue model to improve its prediction performance, transparency, and\ncontrollability. Our TOD-Flow graph learns what a model can, should, and should\nnot predict, effectively reducing the search space and providing a rationale\nfor the model's prediction. We show that the proposed TOD-Flow graph better\nresembles human-annotated graphs compared to prior approaches. Furthermore,\nwhen combined with several dialogue policies and end-to-end dialogue models, we\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly improves dialog act classification\nand end-to-end response generation performance in the MultiWOZ and SGD\nbenchmarks.
