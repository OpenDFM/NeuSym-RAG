    "abstract": "Computer-aided translation (CAT), the use of software to assist a human\ntranslator in the translation process, has been proven to be useful in\nenhancing the productivity of human translators. Autocompletion, which suggests\ntranslation results according to the text pieces provided by human translators,\nis a core function of CAT. There are two limitations in previous research in\nthis line. First, most research works on this topic focus on sentence-level\nautocompletion (i.e., generating the whole translation as a sentence based on\nhuman input), but word-level autocompletion is under-explored so far. Second,\nalmost no public benchmarks are available for the autocompletion task of CAT.\nThis might be among the reasons why research progress in CAT is much slower\ncompared to automatic MT. In this paper, we propose the task of general\nword-level autocompletion (GWLAN) from a real-world CAT scenario, and construct\nthe first public benchmark to facilitate research in this topic. In addition,\nwe propose an effective method for GWLAN and compare it with several strong\nbaselines. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can give\nsignificantly more accurate predictions than the baseline methods on our\nbenchmark datasets.",
