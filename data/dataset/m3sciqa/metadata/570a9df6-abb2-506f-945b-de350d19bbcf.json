    "abstract": "For dialogue response generation, traditional generative models generate\nresponses solely from input queries. Such models rely on insufficient\ninformation for generating a specific response since a certain query could be\nanswered in multiple ways. Consequentially, those models tend to output generic\nand dull responses, impeding the generation of informative utterances.\nRecently, researchers have attempted to fill the information gap by exploiting\ninformation retrieval techniques. When generating a response for a current\nquery, similar dialogues retrieved from the entire training data are considered\nas an additional knowledge source. While this may harvest massive information,\nthe generative models could be overwhelmed, leading to undesirable performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a new framework which exploits retrieval results via\na skeleton-then-response paradigm. At first, a skeleton is generated by\nrevising the retrieved responses. Then, a novel generative model uses both the\ngenerated skeleton and the original query for response generation. Experimental\nresults show that our approaches significantly improve the diversity and\ninformativeness of the generated responses.",
