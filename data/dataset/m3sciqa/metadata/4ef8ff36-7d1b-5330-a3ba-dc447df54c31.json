    "abstract": "Additionally, the strong dependency among in-context examples makes it an\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and enumerating all permutations is\ninfeasible. Hence we propose LENS, a fiLter-thEN-Search method to tackle this\nchallenge in two stages: First we filter the dataset to obtain informative\nin-context examples individually. Specifically, we propose a novel metric,\nInfoScore, to evaluate the example's in-context informativeness based on the\nlanguage model's feedback, and further propose a progressive filtering process\nto filter out uninformative examples. Then we propose diversity-guided example\nsearch which iteratively refines and evaluates the selected example\npermutations, to find examples that fully depict the task. The experimental\nresults show that LENS significantly outperforms a wide range of baselines.",
