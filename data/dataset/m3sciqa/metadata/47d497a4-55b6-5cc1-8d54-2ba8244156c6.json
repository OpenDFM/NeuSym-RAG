    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Few-Shot setting is imperative for entity\ntagging in low resource domains. Existing approaches only learn class-specific\nsemantic features and intermediate representations from source domains. This\naffects generalizability to unseen target domains, resulting in suboptimal\nperformances. To this end, we present CONTaiNER, a novel contrastive learning\ntechnique that optimizes the inter-token distribution distance for Few-Shot\nNER. Instead of optimizing class-specific attributes, CONTaiNER optimizes a\ngeneralized objective of differentiating between token categories based on\ntheir Gaussian-distributed embeddings. This effectively alleviates overfitting\nissues originating from training domains. Our experiments in several\ntraditional test domains (OntoNotes, CoNLL'03, WNUT '17, GUM) and a new large\nscale Few-Shot NER dataset (Few-NERD) demonstrate that on average, CONTaiNER\noutperforms previous methods by 3%-13% absolute F1 points while showing\nconsistent performance trends, even in challenging scenarios where previous\napproaches could not achieve appreciable performance.",
