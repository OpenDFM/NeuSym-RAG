    "abstract": "Dialogue Policy Learning is a key component in a task-oriented dialogue\nsystem (TDS) that decides the next action of the system given the dialogue\nstate at each turn. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly chosen to learn the\ndialogue policy, regarding the user as the environment and the system as the\nagent. Many benchmark datasets and algorithms have been created to facilitate\nthe development and evaluation of dialogue policy based on RL. In this paper,\nwe survey recent advances and challenges in dialogue policy from the\nprescriptive of RL. More specifically, we identify the major problems and\nsummarize corresponding solutions for RL-based dialogue policy learning.\nBesides, we provide a comprehensive survey of applying RL to dialogue policy\nlearning by categorizing recent methods into basic elements in RL. We believe\nthis survey can shed a light on future research in dialogue management.",
