    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted much attention due to their\nability in learning representations from graph-structured data. Despite the\nsuccessful applications of GNNs in many domains, the optimization of GNNs is\nless well studied, and the performance on node classification heavily suffers\nfrom the long-tailed node degree distribution. This paper focuses on improving\nthe performance of GNNs via normalization.\n  In detail, by studying the long-tailed distribution of node degrees in the\ngraph, we propose a novel normalization method for GNNs, which is termed\nResNorm (\\textbf{Res}haping the long-tailed distribution into a normal-like\ndistribution via \\textbf{norm}alization). The $scale$ operation of ResNorm\nreshapes the node-wise standard deviation (NStd) distribution so as to improve\nthe accuracy of tail nodes (\\textit{i}.\\textit{e}., low-degree nodes). We\nprovide a theoretical interpretation and empirical evidence for understanding\nthe mechanism of the above $scale$. In addition to the long-tailed distribution\nissue, over-smoothing is also a fundamental issue plaguing the community. To\nthis end, we analyze the behavior of the standard shift and prove that the\nstandard shift serves as a preconditioner on the weight matrix, increasing the\nrisk of over-smoothing. With the over-smoothing issue in mind, we design a\n$shift$ operation for ResNorm that simulates the degree-specific parameter\nstrategy in a low-cost manner. Extensive experiments have validated the\neffectiveness of ResNorm on several node classification benchmark datasets.",
