    "abstract": "Though great progress has been made for human-machine conversation, current\ndialogue system is still in its infancy: it usually converses passively and\nutters words more as a matter of response, rather than on its own initiatives.\nIn this paper, we take a radical step towards building a human-like\nconversational agent: endowing it with the ability of proactively leading the\nconversation (introducing a new topic or maintaining the current topic). To\nfacilitate the development of such conversation systems, we create a new\ndataset named DuConv where one acts as a conversation leader and the other acts\nas the follower. The leader is provided with a knowledge graph and asked to\nsequentially change the discussion topics, following the given conversation\ngoal, and meanwhile keep the dialogue as natural and engaging as possible.\nDuConv enables a very challenging task as the model needs to both understand\ndialogue and plan over the given knowledge graph. We establish baseline results\non this dataset (about 270K utterances and 30k dialogues) using several\nstate-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that dialogue models that\nplan over the knowledge graph can make full use of related knowledge to\ngenerate more diverse multi-turn conversations. The baseline systems along with\nthe dataset are publicly available",
