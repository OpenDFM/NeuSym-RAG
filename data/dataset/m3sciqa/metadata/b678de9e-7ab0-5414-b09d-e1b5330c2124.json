    "abstract": "Recently, various multimodal networks for Visually-Rich Document\nUnderstanding(VRDU) have been proposed, showing the promotion of transformers\nby integrating visual and layout information with the text embeddings. However,\nmost existing approaches utilize the position embeddings to incorporate the\nsequence information, neglecting the noisy improper reading order obtained by\nOCR tools. In this paper, we propose a robust layout-aware multimodal network\nnamed XYLayoutLM to capture and leverage rich layout information from proper\nreading orders produced by our Augmented XY Cut. Moreover, a Dilated\nConditional Position Encoding module is proposed to deal with the input\nsequence of variable lengths, and it additionally extracts local layout\ninformation from both textual and visual modalities while generating position\nembeddings. Experiment results show that our XYLayoutLM achieves competitive\nresults on document understanding tasks.",
