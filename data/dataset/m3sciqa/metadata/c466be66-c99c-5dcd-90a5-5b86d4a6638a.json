    "abstract": "We have now entered the era of trillion parameter machine learning models\ntrained on billion-sized datasets scraped from the internet. The rise of these\ngargantuan datasets has given rise to formidable bodies of critical work that\nhas called for caution while generating these large datasets. These address\nconcerns surrounding the dubious curation practices used to generate these\ndatasets, the sordid quality of alt-text data available on the world wide web,\nthe problematic content of the CommonCrawl dataset often used as a source for\ntraining large language models, and the entrenched biases in large-scale\nvisio-linguistic models (such as OpenAI's CLIP model) trained on opaque\ndatasets (WebImageText). In the backdrop of these specific calls of caution, we\nexamine the recently released LAION-400M dataset, which is a CLIP-filtered\ndataset of Image-Alt-text pairs parsed from the Common-Crawl dataset. We found\nthat the dataset contains, troublesome and explicit images and text pairs of\nrape, pornography, malign stereotypes, racist and ethnic slurs, and other\nextremely problematic content. We outline numerous implications, concerns and\ndownstream harms regarding the current state of large scale datasets while\nraising open questions for various stakeholders including the AI community,\nregulators, policy makers and data subjects.",
