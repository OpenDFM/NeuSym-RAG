    "abstract": "This paper describes the development of a multilingual, manually annotated\ndataset for three under-resourced Dravidian languages generated from social\nmedia comments. The dataset was annotated for sentiment analysis and offensive\nlanguage identification for a total of more than 60,000 YouTube comments. The\ndataset consists of around 44,000 comments in Tamil-English, around 7,000\ncomments in Kannada-English, and around 20,000 comments in Malayalam-English.\nThe data was manually annotated by volunteer annotators and has a high\ninter-annotator agreement in Krippendorff's alpha. The dataset contains all\ntypes of code-mixing phenomena since it comprises user-generated content from a\nmultilingual country. We also present baseline experiments to establish\nbenchmarks on the dataset using machine learning methods. The dataset is\navailable on Github\n(https://github.com/bharathichezhiyan/DravidianCodeMix-Dataset) and Zenodo\n(https://zenodo.org/record/4750858\\#.YJtw0SYo\\_0M).",
