    "abstract": "Reliable navigation systems have a wide range of applications in robotics and\nautonomous driving. Current approaches employ an open-loop process that\nconverts sensor inputs directly into actions. However, these open-loop schemes\nare challenging to handle complex and dynamic real-world scenarios due to their\npoor generalization. Imitating human navigation, we add a reasoning process to\nconvert actions back to internal latent states, forming a two-stage closed loop\nof perception, decision-making, and reasoning. Firstly, VAE-Enhanced\nDemonstration Learning endows the model with the understanding of basic\nnavigation rules. Then, two dual processes in RL-Enhanced Interaction Learning\ngenerate reward feedback for each other and collectively enhance obstacle\navoidance capability. The reasoning model can substantially promote\ngeneralization and robustness, and facilitate the deployment of the algorithm\nto real-world robots without elaborate transfers. Experiments show our method\nis more adaptable to novel scenarios compared with state-of-the-art approaches.",
