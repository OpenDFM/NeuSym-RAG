    "abstract": "Language models generate texts by successively predicting probability\ndistributions for next tokens given past ones. A growing field of interest\ntries to leverage external information in the decoding process so that the\ngenerated texts have desired properties, such as being more natural, non toxic,\nfaithful, or having a specific writing style. A solution is to use a classifier\nat each generation step, resulting in a cooperative environment where the\nclassifier guides the decoding of the language model distribution towards\nrelevant texts for the task at hand. In this paper, we examine three families\nof (transformer-based) discriminators for this specific task of cooperative\ndecoding: bidirectional, left-to-right and generative ones. We evaluate the\npros and cons of these different types of discriminators for cooperative\ngeneration, exploring respective accuracy on classification tasks along with\ntheir impact on the resulting sample quality and computational performances. We\nalso provide the code of a batched implementation of the powerful cooperative\ndecoding strategy used for our experiments, the Monte Carlo Tree Search,\nworking with each discriminator for Natural Language Generation.",
