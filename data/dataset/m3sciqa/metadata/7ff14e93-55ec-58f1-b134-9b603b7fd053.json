    "abstract": "There has been considerable progress made towards conversational models that\ngenerate coherent and fluent responses; however, this often involves training\nlarge language models on large dialogue datasets, such as Reddit. These large\nconversational models provide little control over the generated responses, and\nthis control is further limited in the absence of annotated conversational\ndatasets for attribute specific generation that can be used for fine-tuning the\nmodel. In this paper, we first propose and evaluate plug-and-play methods for\ncontrollable response generation, which does not require dialogue specific\ndatasets and does not rely on fine-tuning a large model. While effective, the\ndecoding procedure induces considerable computational overhead, rendering the\nconversational model unsuitable for interactive usage. To overcome this, we\nintroduce an approach that does not require further computation at decoding\ntime, while also does not require any fine-tuning of a large language model. We\ndemonstrate, through extensive automatic and human evaluation, a high degree of\ncontrol over the generated conversational responses with regard to multiple\ndesired attributes, while being fluent.",
