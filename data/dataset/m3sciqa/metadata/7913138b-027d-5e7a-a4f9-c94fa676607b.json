    "abstract": "Informational bias is bias conveyed through sentences or clauses that provide\ntangential, speculative or background information that can sway readers'\nopinions towards entities. By nature, informational bias is context-dependent,\nbut previous work on informational bias detection has not explored the role of\ncontext beyond the sentence. In this paper, we explore four kinds of context\nfor informational bias in English news articles: neighboring sentences, the\nfull article, articles on the same event from other news publishers, and\narticles from the same domain (but potentially different events). We find that\nintegrating event context improves classification performance over a very\nstrong baseline. In addition, we perform the first error analysis of models on\nthis task. We find that the best-performing context-inclusive model outperforms\nthe baseline on longer sentences, and sentences from politically centrist\narticles.",
