    "abstract": "We present a document-grounded matching network (DGMN) for response selection\nthat can power a knowledge-aware retrieval-based chatbot system. The challenges\nof building such a model lie in how to ground conversation contexts with\nbackground documents and how to recognize important information in the\ndocuments for matching. To overcome the challenges, DGMN fuses information in a\ndocument and a context into representations of each other, and dynamically\ndetermines if grounding is necessary and importance of different parts of the\ndocument and the context through hierarchical interaction with a response at\nthe matching step. Empirical studies on two public data sets indicate that DGMN\ncan significantly improve upon state-of-the-art methods and at the same time\nenjoys good interpretability.",
