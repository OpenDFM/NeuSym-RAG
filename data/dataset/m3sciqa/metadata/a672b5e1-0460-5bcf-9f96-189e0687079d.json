    "abstract": "Social media platforms have been used for information and news gathering, and\nthey are very valuable in many applications. However, they also lead to the\nspreading of rumors and fake news. Many efforts have been taken to detect and\ndebunk rumors on social media by analyzing their content and social context\nusing machine learning techniques. This paper gives an overview of the recent\nstudies in the rumor detection field. It provides a comprehensive list of\ndatasets used for rumor detection, and reviews the important studies based on\nwhat types of information they exploit and the approaches they take. And more\nimportantly, we also present several new directions for future research.",
