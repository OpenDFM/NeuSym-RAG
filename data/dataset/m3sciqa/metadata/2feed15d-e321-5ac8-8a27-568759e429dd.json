    "abstract": "As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in\npopularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in\nshaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success\nin modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender\nbias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence\nis not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In\nthis paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender\nbias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias\nand analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the\nadvantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we\ndiscuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.",
