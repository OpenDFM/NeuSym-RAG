    "abstract": "We present a scalable approach for semi-supervised learning on\ngraph-structured data that is based on an efficient variant of convolutional\nneural networks which operate directly on graphs. We motivate the choice of our\nconvolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of\nspectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph\nedges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph\nstructure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation\nnetworks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms related methods by a significant margin.",
