    "abstract": "End-to-end task-oriented dialog systems usually suffer from the challenge of\nincorporating knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a novel yet simple\nend-to-end differentiable model called memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) to address\nthis issue. Mem2Seq is the first neural generative model that combines the\nmulti-hop attention over memories with the idea of pointer network. We\nempirically show how Mem2Seq controls each generation step, and how its\nmulti-hop attention mechanism helps in learning correlations between memories.\nIn addition, our model is quite general without complicated task-specific\ndesigns. As a result, we show that Mem2Seq can be trained faster and attain the\nstate-of-the-art performance on three different task-oriented dialog datasets.",
