    "abstract": "The rise in hateful and offensive language directed at other users is one of\nthe adverse side effects of the increased use of social networking platforms.\nThis could make it difficult for human moderators to review tagged comments\nfiltered by classification systems. To help address this issue, we present the\nViHOS (Vietnamese Hate and Offensive Spans) dataset, the first human-annotated\ncorpus containing 26k spans on 11k comments. We also provide definitions of\nhateful and offensive spans in Vietnamese comments as well as detailed\nannotation guidelines. Besides, we conduct experiments with various\nstate-of-the-art models. Specifically, XLM-R$_{Large}$ achieved the best\nF1-scores in Single span detection and All spans detection, while\nPhoBERT$_{Large}$ obtained the highest in Multiple spans detection. Finally,\nour error analysis demonstrates the difficulties in detecting specific types of\nspans in our data for future research.\n  Disclaimer: This paper contains real comments that could be considered\nprofane, offensive, or abusive.",
