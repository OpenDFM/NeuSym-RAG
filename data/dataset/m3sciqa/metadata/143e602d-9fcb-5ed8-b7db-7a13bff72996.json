    "abstract": "The sheer volume of financial statements makes it difficult for humans to\naccess and analyze a business's financials. Robust numerical reasoning likewise\nfaces unique challenges in this domain. In this work, we focus on answering\ndeep questions over financial data, aiming to automate the analysis of a large\ncorpus of financial documents. In contrast to existing tasks on general domain,\nthe finance domain includes complex numerical reasoning and understanding of\nheterogeneous representations. To facilitate analytical progress, we propose a\nnew large-scale dataset, FinQA, with Question-Answering pairs over Financial\nreports, written by financial experts. We also annotate the gold reasoning\nprograms to ensure full explainability. We further introduce baselines and\nconduct comprehensive experiments in our dataset. The results demonstrate that\npopular, large, pre-trained models fall far short of expert humans in acquiring\nfinance knowledge and in complex multi-step numerical reasoning on that\nknowledge. Our dataset -- the first of its kind -- should therefore enable\nsignificant, new community research into complex application domains. The\ndataset and code are publicly available\\url{https://github.com/czyssrs/FinQA}.",
