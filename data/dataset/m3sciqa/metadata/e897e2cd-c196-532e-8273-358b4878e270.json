    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning, aiming at endowing machines with a human-like ability\nto make situational presumptions, is extremely challenging to generalize. For\nsomeone who barely knows about \"meditation,\" while is knowledgeable about\n\"singing,\" he can still infer that \"meditation makes people relaxed\" from the\nexisting knowledge that \"singing makes people relaxed\" by first conceptualizing\n\"singing\" as a \"relaxing event\" and then instantiating that event to\n\"meditation.\" This process, known as conceptual induction and deduction, is\nfundamental to commonsense reasoning while lacking both labeled data and\nmethodologies to enhance commonsense modeling. To fill such a research gap, we\npropose CAT (Contextualized ConceptuAlization and InsTantiation), a\nsemi-supervised learning framework that integrates event conceptualization and\ninstantiation to conceptualize commonsense knowledge bases at scale. Extensive\nexperiments show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performances on\ntwo conceptualization tasks, and the acquired abstract commonsense knowledge\ncan significantly improve commonsense inference modeling. Our code, data, and\nfine-tuned models are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/CAT.",
