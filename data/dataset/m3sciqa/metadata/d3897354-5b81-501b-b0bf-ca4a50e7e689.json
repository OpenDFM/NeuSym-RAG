    "abstract": "Generating high quality question-answer pairs is a hard but meaningful task.\nAlthough previous works have achieved great results on answer-aware question\ngeneration, it is difficult to apply them into practical application in the\neducation field. This paper for the first time addresses the question-answer\npair generation task on the real-world examination data, and proposes a new\nunified framework on RACE. To capture the important information of the input\npassage we first automatically generate(rather than extracting) keyphrases,\nthus this task is reduced to keyphrase-question-answer triplet joint\ngeneration. Accordingly, we propose a multi-agent communication model to\ngenerate and optimize the question and keyphrases iteratively, and then apply\nthe generated question and keyphrases to guide the generation of answers. To\nestablish a solid benchmark, we build our model on the strong generative\npre-training model. Experimental results show that our model makes great\nbreakthroughs in the question-answer pair generation task. Moreover, we make a\ncomprehensive analysis on our model, suggesting new directions for this\nchallenging task.",
