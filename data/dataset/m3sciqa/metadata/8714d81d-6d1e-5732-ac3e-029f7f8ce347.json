    "abstract": "Information extraction suffers from its varying targets, heterogeneous\nstructures, and demand-specific schemas. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntext-to-structure generation framework, namely UIE, which can universally model\ndifferent IE tasks, adaptively generate targeted structures, and\ncollaboratively learn general IE abilities from different knowledge sources.\nSpecifically, UIE uniformly encodes different extraction structures via a\nstructured extraction language, adaptively generates target extractions via a\nschema-based prompt mechanism - structural schema instructor, and captures the\ncommon IE abilities via a large-scale pre-trained text-to-structure model.\nExperiments show that UIE achieved the state-of-the-art performance on 4 IE\ntasks, 13 datasets, and on all supervised, low-resource, and few-shot settings\nfor a wide range of entity, relation, event and sentiment extraction tasks and\ntheir unification. These results verified the effectiveness, universality, and\ntransferability of UIE.",
