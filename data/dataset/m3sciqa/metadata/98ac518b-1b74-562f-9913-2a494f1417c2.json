    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the significant advance in dense retrieval (DR)\nbased on powerful pre-trained language models (PLM). DR models have achieved\nexcellent performance in several benchmark datasets, while they are shown to be\nnot as competitive as traditional sparse retrieval models (e.g., BM25) in a\nzero-shot retrieval setting. However, in the related literature, there still\nlacks a detailed and comprehensive study on zero-shot retrieval. In this paper,\nwe present the first thorough examination of the zero-shot capability of DR\nmodels. We aim to identify the key factors and analyze how they affect\nzero-shot retrieval performance. In particular, we discuss the effect of\nseveral key factors related to source training set, analyze the potential bias\nfrom the target dataset, and review and compare existing zero-shot DR models.\nOur findings provide important evidence to better understand and develop\nzero-shot DR models.",
