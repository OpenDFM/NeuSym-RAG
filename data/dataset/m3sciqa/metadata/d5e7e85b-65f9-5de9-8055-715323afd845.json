    "abstract": "Scalar inferences (SI) are a signature example of how humans interpret\nlanguage based on unspoken alternatives. While empirical studies have\ndemonstrated that human SI rates are highly variable -- both within instances\nof a single scale, and across different scales -- there have been few proposals\nthat quantitatively explain both cross- and within-scale variation.\nFurthermore, while it is generally assumed that SIs arise through reasoning\nabout unspoken alternatives, it remains debated whether humans reason about\nalternatives as linguistic forms, or at the level of concepts. Here, we test a\nshared mechanism explaining SI rates within and across scales: context-driven\nexpectations about the unspoken alternatives. Using neural language models to\napproximate human predictive distributions, we find that SI rates are captured\nby the expectedness of the strong scalemate as an alternative. Crucially,\nhowever, expectedness robustly predicts cross-scale variation only under a\nmeaning-based view of alternatives. Our results suggest that pragmatic\ninferences arise from context-driven expectations over alternatives, and these\nexpectations operate at the level of concepts.",
