    "abstract": "Meetings are a key component of human collaboration. As increasing numbers of\nmeetings are recorded and transcribed, meeting summaries have become essential\nto remind those who may or may not have attended the meetings about the key\ndecisions made and the tasks to be completed. However, it is hard to create a\nsingle short summary that covers all the content of a long meeting involving\nmultiple people and topics. In order to satisfy the needs of different types of\nusers, we define a new query-based multi-domain meeting summarization task,\nwhere models have to select and summarize relevant spans of meetings in\nresponse to a query, and we introduce QMSum, a new benchmark for this task.\nQMSum consists of 1,808 query-summary pairs over 232 meetings in multiple\ndomains. Besides, we investigate a locate-then-summarize method and evaluate a\nset of strong summarization baselines on the task. Experimental results and\nmanual analysis reveal that QMSum presents significant challenges in long\nmeeting summarization for future research. Dataset is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/Yale-LILY/QMSum}.",
