    "abstract": "We introduce The House Of inteRactions (THOR), a framework for visual AI\nresearch, available at http://ai2thor.allenai.org. AI2-THOR consists of near\nphoto-realistic 3D indoor scenes, where AI agents can navigate in the scenes\nand interact with objects to perform tasks. AI2-THOR enables research in many\ndifferent domains including but not limited to deep reinforcement learning,\nimitation learning, learning by interaction, planning, visual question\nanswering, unsupervised representation learning, object detection and\nsegmentation, and learning models of cognition. The goal of AI2-THOR is to\nfacilitate building visually intelligent models and push the research forward\nin this domain.",
