    "abstract": "Recently, considerable literature has grown up around the theme of few-shot\nnamed entity recognition (NER), but little published benchmark data\nspecifically focused on the practical and challenging task. Current approaches\ncollect existing supervised NER datasets and re-organize them to the few-shot\nsetting for empirical study. These strategies conventionally aim to recognize\ncoarse-grained entity types with few examples, while in practice, most unseen\nentity types are fine-grained. In this paper, we present Few-NERD, a\nlarge-scale human-annotated few-shot NER dataset with a hierarchy of 8\ncoarse-grained and 66 fine-grained entity types. Few-NERD consists of 188,238\nsentences from Wikipedia, 4,601,160 words are included and each is annotated as\ncontext or a part of a two-level entity type. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first few-shot NER dataset and the largest human-crafted NER\ndataset. We construct benchmark tasks with different emphases to\ncomprehensively assess the generalization capability of models. Extensive\nempirical results and analysis show that Few-NERD is challenging and the\nproblem requires further research. We make Few-NERD public at\nhttps://ningding97.github.io/fewnerd/.",
