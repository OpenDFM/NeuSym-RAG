    "abstract": "In previous research, knowledge-selection tasks mostly rely on language\nmodel-based methods or knowledge ranking. However, while approaches that rely\non the language models take all knowledge as sequential input, knowledge does\nnot contain sequential information in most circumstances. On the other hand,\nthe knowledge-ranking methods leverage dialog history and each given knowledge\nsnippet separately, but they do not consider information between knowledge\nsnippets. In the Tenth Dialog System Technology Challenges (DSTC10), we\nparticipated in the second Knowledge-grounded Task-oriented Dialogue Modeling\non Spoken Conversations. To deal with the problems mentioned above, we modified\ntraining methods based on state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for the first and\nthird sub-tasks. As for the second sub-task of knowledge selection, we proposed\nGraph-Knowledge Selector (GKS), utilizing a graph-attention base model\nincorporated with the language model. GKS makes knowledge-selection decisions\nin the dialog by simultaneously considering each knowledge embedding generated\nfrom the language model without sequential features. Moreover, GKS leverages\nconsiderable knowledge in decision-making and takes relations across knowledge\nas part of the selection process. As a result, GKS outperforms several SOTA\nmodels proposed in the data-set on knowledge selection from the Ninth Dialog\nSystem Technology Challenges (DSTC9).",
