    "abstract": "Advancement in large pretrained language models has significantly improved\ntheir performance for conditional language generation tasks including\nsummarization albeit with hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations,\nconventional methods proposed improving beam search or using a fact checker as\na postprocessing step. In this paper, we investigate the use of the Natural\nLanguage Inference (NLI) entailment metric to detect and prevent hallucinations\nin summary generation. We propose an NLI-assisted beam re-ranking mechanism by\ncomputing entailment probability scores between the input context and\nsummarization model-generated beams during saliency-enhanced greedy decoding.\nMoreover, a diversity metric is introduced to compare its effectiveness against\nvanilla beam search. Our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms vanilla\nbeam decoding on XSum and CNN/DM datasets.",
