    "abstract": "The use of irony and sarcasm in social media allows us to study them at scale\nfor the first time. However, their diversity has made it difficult to construct\na high-quality corpus of sarcasm in dialogue. Here, we describe the process of\ncreating a large- scale, highly-diverse corpus of online debate forums\ndialogue, and our novel methods for operationalizing classes of sarcasm in the\nform of rhetorical questions and hyperbole. We show that we can use\nlexico-syntactic cues to reliably retrieve sarcastic utterances with high\naccuracy. To demonstrate the properties and quality of our corpus, we conduct\nsupervised learning experiments with simple features, and show that we achieve\nboth higher precision and F than previous work on sarcasm in debate forums\ndialogue. We apply a weakly-supervised linguistic pattern learner and\nqualitatively analyze the linguistic differences in each class.",
