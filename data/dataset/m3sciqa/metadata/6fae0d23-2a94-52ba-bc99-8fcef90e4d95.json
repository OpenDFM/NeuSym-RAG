    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis seeks to identify the viewpoint(s) underlying a text span;\nan example application is classifying a movie review as \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs\ndown\". To determine this sentiment polarity, we propose a novel\nmachine-learning method that applies text-categorization techniques to just the\nsubjective portions of the document. Extracting these portions can be\nimplemented using efficient techniques for finding minimum cuts in graphs; this\ngreatly facilitates incorporation of cross-sentence contextual constraints.",
