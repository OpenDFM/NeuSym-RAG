    "abstract": "Querying the knowledge base (KB) has long been a challenge in the end-to-end\ntask-oriented dialogue system. Previous sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) dialogue\ngeneration work treats the KB query as an attention over the entire KB, without\nthe guarantee that the generated entities are consistent with each other. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework which queries the KB in two steps to\nimprove the consistency of generated entities. In the first step, inspired by\nthe observation that a response can usually be supported by a single KB row, we\nintroduce a KB retrieval component which explicitly returns the most relevant\nKB row given a dialogue history. The retrieval result is further used to filter\nthe irrelevant entities in a Seq2Seq response generation model to improve the\nconsistency among the output entities. In the second step, we further perform\nthe attention mechanism to address the most correlated KB column. Two methods\nare proposed to make the training feasible without labeled retrieval data,\nwhich include distant supervision and Gumbel-Softmax technique. Experiments on\ntwo publicly available task oriented dialog datasets show the effectiveness of\nour model by outperforming the baseline systems and producing entity-consistent\nresponses.",
