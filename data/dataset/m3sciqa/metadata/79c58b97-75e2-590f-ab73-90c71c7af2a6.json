    "abstract": "We introduce a new type of deep contextualized word representation that\nmodels both (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and\nsemantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to\nmodel polysemy). Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states\nof a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large\ntext corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing\nmodels and significantly improve the state of the art across six challenging\nNLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment\nanalysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals\nof the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix\ndifferent types of semi-supervision signals.",
