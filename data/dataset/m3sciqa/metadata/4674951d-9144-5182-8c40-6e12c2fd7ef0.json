    "abstract": "Simultaneous translation is vastly different from full-sentence translation,\nin the sense that it starts translation before the source sentence ends, with\nonly a few words delay. However, due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality\nsimultaneous translation datasets, most such systems are still trained on\nconventional full-sentence bitexts. This is far from ideal for the simultaneous\nscenario due to the abundance of unnecessary long-distance reorderings in those\nbitexts. We propose a novel method that rewrites the target side of existing\nfull-sentence corpora into simultaneous-style translation. Experiments on\nZh->En and Ja->En simultaneous translation show substantial improvements (up to\n+2.7 BLEU) with the addition of these generated pseudo-references.",
