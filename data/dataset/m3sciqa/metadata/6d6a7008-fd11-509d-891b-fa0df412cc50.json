    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) contain vast amounts of factual knowledge,\nbut how the knowledge is stored in the parameters remains unclear. This paper\ndelves into the complex task of understanding how factual knowledge is stored\nin multilingual PLMs, and introduces the Architecture-adapted Multilingual\nIntegrated Gradients method, which successfully localizes knowledge neurons\nmore precisely compared to current methods, and is more universal across\nvarious architectures and languages. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth\nexploration of knowledge neurons, leading to the following two important\ndiscoveries: (1) The discovery of Language-Independent Knowledge Neurons, which\nstore factual knowledge in a form that transcends language. We design\ncross-lingual knowledge editing experiments, demonstrating that the PLMs can\naccomplish this task based on language-independent neurons; (2) The discovery\nof Degenerate Knowledge Neurons, a novel type of neuron showing that different\nknowledge neurons can store the same fact. Its property of functional overlap\nendows the PLMs with a robust mastery of factual knowledge. We design\nfact-checking experiments, proving that the degenerate knowledge neurons can\nhelp the PLMs to detect wrong facts. Experiments corroborate these findings,\nshedding light on the mechanisms of factual knowledge storage in multilingual\nPLMs, and contribute valuable insights to the field.
