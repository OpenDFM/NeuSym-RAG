    "abstract": "English and Chinese, known as resource-rich languages, have witnessed the\nstrong development of transformer-based language models for natural language\nprocessing tasks. Although Vietnam has approximately 100M people speaking\nVietnamese, several pre-trained models, e.g., PhoBERT, ViBERT, and vELECTRA,\nperformed well on general Vietnamese NLP tasks, including POS tagging and named\nentity recognition. These pre-trained language models are still limited to\nVietnamese social media tasks. In this paper, we present the first monolingual\npre-trained language model for Vietnamese social media texts, ViSoBERT, which\nis pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of high-quality and diverse Vietnamese\nsocial media texts using XLM-R architecture. Moreover, we explored our\npre-trained model on five important natural language downstream tasks on\nVietnamese social media texts: emotion recognition, hate speech detection,\nsentiment analysis, spam reviews detection, and hate speech spans detection.\nOur experiments demonstrate that ViSoBERT, with far fewer parameters, surpasses\nthe previous state-of-the-art models on multiple Vietnamese social media tasks.\nOur ViSoBERT model is available only for research purposes.",
