    "abstract": "With the rise of prolific ChatGPT, the risk and consequences of AI-generated\ntext has increased alarmingly. To address the inevitable question of ownership\nattribution for AI-generated artifacts, the US Copyright Office released a\nstatement stating that 'If a work's traditional elements of authorship were\nproduced by a machine, the work lacks human authorship and the Office will not\nregister it'. Furthermore, both the US and the EU governments have recently\ndrafted their initial proposals regarding the regulatory framework for AI.\nGiven this cynosural spotlight on generative AI, AI-generated text detection\n(AGTD) has emerged as a topic that has already received immediate attention in\nresearch, with some initial methods having been proposed, soon followed by\nemergence of techniques to bypass detection. This paper introduces the Counter\nTuring Test (CT^2), a benchmark consisting of techniques aiming to offer a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the robustness of existing AGTD techniques. Our\nempirical findings unequivocally highlight the fragility of the proposed AGTD\nmethods under scrutiny. Amidst the extensive deliberations on policy-making for\nregulating AI development, it is of utmost importance to assess the\ndetectability of content generated by LLMs. Thus, to establish a quantifiable\nspectrum facilitating the evaluation and ranking of LLMs according to their\ndetectability levels, we propose the AI Detectability Index (ADI). We conduct a\nthorough examination of 15 contemporary LLMs, empirically demonstrating that\nlarger LLMs tend to have a higher ADI, indicating they are less detectable\ncompared to smaller LLMs. We firmly believe that ADI holds significant value as\na tool for the wider NLP community, with the potential to serve as a rubric in\nAI-related policy-making.",
