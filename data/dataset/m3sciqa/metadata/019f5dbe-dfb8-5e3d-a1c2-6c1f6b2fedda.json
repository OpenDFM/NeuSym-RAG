    "abstract": "Interactive Natural Language Processing (iNLP) has emerged as a novel\nparadigm within the field of NLP, aimed at addressing limitations in existing\nframeworks while aligning with the ultimate goals of artificial intelligence.\nThis paradigm considers language models as agents capable of observing, acting,\nand receiving feedback iteratively from external entities. Specifically,\nlanguage models in this context can: (1) interact with humans for better\nunderstanding and addressing user needs, personalizing responses, aligning with\nhuman values, and improving the overall user experience; (2) interact with\nknowledge bases for enriching language representations with factual knowledge,\nenhancing the contextual relevance of responses, and dynamically leveraging\nexternal information to generate more accurate and informed responses; (3)\ninteract with models and tools for effectively decomposing and addressing\ncomplex tasks, leveraging specialized expertise for specific subtasks, and\nfostering the simulation of social behaviors; and (4) interact with\nenvironments for learning grounded representations of language, and effectively\ntackling embodied tasks such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making in\nresponse to environmental observations. This paper offers a comprehensive\nsurvey of iNLP, starting by proposing a unified definition and framework of the\nconcept. We then provide a systematic classification of iNLP, dissecting its\nvarious components, including interactive objects, interaction interfaces, and\ninteraction methods. We proceed to delve into the evaluation methodologies used\nin the field, explore its diverse applications, scrutinize its ethical and\nsafety issues, and discuss prospective research directions. This survey serves\nas an entry point for researchers who are interested in this rapidly evolving\narea and offers a broad view of the current landscape and future trajectory of\niNLP.",
