    "abstract": "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands\nfor Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent\nlanguage representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep\nbidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on\nboth left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT\nmodel can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create\nstate-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering\nand language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture\nmodifications.\n  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new\nstate-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including\npushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering\nTest F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).",
