    "abstract": "A vast amount of geographic information exists in natural language texts,\nsuch as tweets and news. Extracting geographic information from texts is called\nGeoparsing, which includes two subtasks: toponym recognition and toponym\ndisambiguation, i.e., to identify the geospatial representations of toponyms.\nThis paper focuses on toponym disambiguation, which is usually approached by\ntoponym resolution and entity linking. Recently, many novel approaches have\nbeen proposed, especially deep learning-based approaches, such as CamCoder,\nGENRE, and BLINK. In this paper, a spatial clustering-based voting approach\nthat combines several individual approaches is proposed to improve SOTA\nperformance in terms of robustness and generalizability. Experiments are\nconducted to compare a voting ensemble with 20 latest and commonly-used\napproaches based on 12 public datasets, including several highly ambiguous and\nchallenging datasets (e.g., WikToR and CLDW). The datasets are of six types:\ntweets, historical documents, news, web pages, scientific articles, and\nWikipedia articles, containing in total 98,300 places across the world. The\nresults show that the voting ensemble performs the best on all the datasets,\nachieving an average Accuracy@161km of 0.86, proving the generalizability and\nrobustness of the voting approach. Also, the voting ensemble drastically\nimproves the performance of resolving fine-grained places, i.e., POIs, natural\nfeatures, and traffic ways.",
