    "abstract": "In this paper, we revisit the solving bias when evaluating models on current\nMath Word Problem (MWP) benchmarks. However, current solvers exist solving bias\nwhich consists of data bias and learning bias due to biased dataset and\nimproper training strategy. Our experiments verify MWP solvers are easy to be\nbiased by the biased training datasets which do not cover diverse questions for\neach problem narrative of all MWPs, thus a solver can only learn shallow\nheuristics rather than deep semantics for understanding problems. Besides, an\nMWP can be naturally solved by multiple equivalent equations while current\ndatasets take only one of the equivalent equations as ground truth, forcing the\nmodel to match the labeled ground truth and ignoring other equivalent\nequations. Here, we first introduce a novel MWP dataset named UnbiasedMWP which\nis constructed by varying the grounded expressions in our collected data and\nannotating them with corresponding multiple new questions manually. Then, to\nfurther mitigate learning bias, we propose a Dynamic Target Selection (DTS)\nStrategy to dynamically select more suitable target expressions according to\nthe longest prefix match between the current model output and candidate\nequivalent equations which are obtained by applying commutative law during\ntraining. The results show that our UnbiasedMWP has significantly fewer biases\nthan its original data and other datasets, posing a promising benchmark for\nfairly evaluating the solvers' reasoning skills rather than matching nearest\nneighbors. And the solvers trained with our DTS achieve higher accuracies on\nmultiple MWP benchmarks. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/yangzhch6/UnbiasedMWP.",
