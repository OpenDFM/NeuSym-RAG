    "abstract": "Propaganda aims at influencing people's mindset with the purpose of advancing\na specific agenda. Previous work has addressed propaganda detection at the\ndocument level, typically labelling all articles from a propagandistic news\noutlet as propaganda. Such noisy gold labels inevitably affect the quality of\nany learning system trained on them. A further issue with most existing systems\nis the lack of explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a\nnovel task: performing fine-grained analysis of texts by detecting all\nfragments that contain propaganda techniques as well as their type. In\nparticular, we create a corpus of news articles manually annotated at the\nfragment level with eighteen propaganda techniques and we propose a suitable\nevaluation measure. We further design a novel multi-granularity neural network,\nand we show that it outperforms several strong BERT-based baselines.",
