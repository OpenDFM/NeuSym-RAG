    "abstract": "Existing question answering (QA) techniques are created mainly to answer\nquestions asked by humans. But in educational applications, teachers often need\nto decide what questions they should ask, in order to help students to improve\ntheir narrative understanding capabilities. We design an automated\nquestion-answer generation (QAG) system for this education scenario: given a\nstory book at the kindergarten to eighth-grade level as input, our system can\nautomatically generate QA pairs that are capable of testing a variety of\ndimensions of a student's comprehension skills. Our proposed QAG model\narchitecture is demonstrated using a new expert-annotated FairytaleQA dataset,\nwhich has 278 child-friendly storybooks with 10,580 QA pairs. Automatic and\nhuman evaluations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art QAG baseline\nsystems. On top of our QAG system, we also start to build an interactive\nstory-telling application for the future real-world deployment in this\neducational scenario.",
