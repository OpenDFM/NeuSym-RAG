    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for the\ndeployment of deep neural networks. This paper introduces the HEAT model, a new\npost-hoc OOD detection method estimating the density of in-distribution (ID)\nsamples using hybrid energy-based models (EBM) in the feature space of a\npre-trained backbone. HEAT complements prior density estimators of the ID\ndensity, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to\nprovide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second contribution is to\nleverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation and to\ncompose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsignificance of the two contributions. HEAT sets new state-of-the-art OOD\ndetection results on the CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-100 benchmark as well as on the\nlarge-scale Imagenet benchmark. The code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/MarcLafon/heatood.",
