    "abstract": "Math word problems (MWPs) is a task that automatically derives solution\nexpression from a giving math problems in text. The previous studies suffer\nfrom spurious correlations between input text and output expression. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose a self-consistent reasoning framework called\nSCR, which attempts to adopt a pruning strategy to correct the output\ndistribution shift so as to implicitly fix those spurious correlative samples.\nSpecifically, we firstly obtain a sub-network by pruning a roberta2tree model,\nfor the sake to use the gap on output distribution between the original\nroberta2tree model and the pruned sub-network to expose spurious correlative\nsamples. Then, we calibrate the output distribution shift by applying symmetric\nKullback-Leibler divergence to alleviate spurious correlations. In addition,\nSCR generates equivalent expressions, thereby, capturing the original text's\nlogic rather than relying on hints from original text. Extensive experiments on\ntwo large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms\nthe strong baseline methods.",
