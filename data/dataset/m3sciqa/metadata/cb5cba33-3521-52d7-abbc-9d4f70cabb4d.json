    "abstract": "In biomedical natural language processing, named entity recognition (NER) and\nnamed entity normalization (NEN) are key tasks that enable the automatic\nextraction of biomedical entities (e.g. diseases and drugs) from the\never-growing biomedical literature. In this article, we present BERN2 (Advanced\nBiomedical Entity Recognition and Normalization), a tool that improves the\nprevious neural network-based NER tool by employing a multi-task NER model and\nneural network-based NEN models to achieve much faster and more accurate\ninference. We hope that our tool can help annotate large-scale biomedical texts\nfor various tasks such as biomedical knowledge graph construction.",
