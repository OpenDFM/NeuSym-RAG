    "abstract": "Text summarization has been a crucial problem in natural language processing\n(NLP) for several decades. It aims to condense lengthy documents into shorter\nversions while retaining the most critical information. Various methods have\nbeen proposed for text summarization, including extractive and abstractive\nsummarization. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and\nChatGPT has recently created significant interest in using these models for\ntext summarization tasks. Recent studies \\cite{goyal2022news,\nzhang2023benchmarking} have shown that LLMs-generated news summaries are\nalready on par with humans. However, the performance of LLMs for more practical\napplications like aspect or query-based summaries is underexplored. To fill\nthis gap, we conducted an evaluation of ChatGPT's performance on four widely\nused benchmark datasets, encompassing diverse summaries from Reddit posts, news\narticles, dialogue meetings, and stories. Our experiments reveal that ChatGPT's\nperformance is comparable to traditional fine-tuning methods in terms of Rouge\nscores. Moreover, we highlight some unique differences between\nChatGPT-generated summaries and human references, providing valuable insights\ninto the superpower of ChatGPT for diverse text summarization tasks. Our\nfindings call for new directions in this area, and we plan to conduct further\nresearch to systematically examine the characteristics of ChatGPT-generated\nsummaries through extensive human evaluation.",
