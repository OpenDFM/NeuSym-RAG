    "abstract": "Eric Brill introduced transformation-based learning and showed that it can do\npart-of-speech tagging with fairly high accuracy. The same method can be\napplied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the\ntagged text, including non-recursive ``baseNP'' chunks. For this purpose, it is\nconvenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk\nstructure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using\nTreebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of\nroughly 92% for baseNP chunks and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that\npartition the sentence. Some interesting adaptations to the\ntransformation-based learning approach are also suggested by this application.",
