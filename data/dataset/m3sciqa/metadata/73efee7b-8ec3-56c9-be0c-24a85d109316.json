    "abstract": "This work explores the problem of generating task graphs of real-world\nactivities. Different from prior formulations, we consider a setting where text\ntranscripts of instructional videos performing a real-world activity (e.g.,\nmaking coffee) are provided and the goal is to identify the key steps relevant\nto the task as well as the dependency relationship between these key steps. We\npropose a novel task graph generation approach that combines the reasoning\ncapabilities of instruction-tuned language models along with clustering and\nranking components to generate accurate task graphs in a completely\nunsupervised manner. We show that the proposed approach generates more accurate\ntask graphs compared to a supervised learning approach on tasks from the ProceL\nand CrossTask datasets.",
