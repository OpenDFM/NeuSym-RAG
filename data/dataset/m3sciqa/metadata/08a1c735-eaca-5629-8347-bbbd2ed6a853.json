    "abstract": "Chit-chat models are known to have several problems: they lack specificity,\ndo not display a consistent personality and are often not very captivating. In\nthis work we present the task of making chit-chat more engaging by conditioning\non profile information. We collect data and train models to (i) condition on\ntheir given profile information; and (ii) information about the person they are\ntalking to, resulting in improved dialogues, as measured by next utterance\nprediction. Since (ii) is initially unknown our model is trained to engage its\npartner with personal topics, and we show the resulting dialogue can be used to\npredict profile information about the interlocutors.",
