    "abstract": "Unlike widely used Named Entity Recognition (NER) data sets in generic\ndomains, biomedical NER data sets often contain mentions consisting of\ndiscontinuous spans. Conventional sequence tagging techniques encode Markov\nassumptions that are efficient but preclude recovery of these mentions. We\npropose a simple, effective transition-based model with generic neural encoding\nfor discontinuous NER. Through extensive experiments on three biomedical data\nsets, we show that our model can effectively recognize discontinuous mentions\nwithout sacrificing the accuracy on continuous mentions.",
