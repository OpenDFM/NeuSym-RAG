    "abstract": "Recent AI-assistant agents, such as ChatGPT, predominantly rely on supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF) to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human\nintentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical, and reliable. However, this\ndependence can significantly constrain the true potential of AI-assistant\nagents due to the high cost of obtaining human supervision and the related\nissues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable\nbiases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called\nSELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power\nof LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our\napproach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic\nprompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we\nuse a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide\nthe LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles\napplication) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's\nqueries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality\nself-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable\nresponses for each query directly without the principle set and the\ndemonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the\nissues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the\nLLaMA-65b base language model, we develop an AI assistant named Dromedary. With\nfewer than 300 lines of human annotations (including < 200 seed prompts, 16\ngeneric principles, and 5 exemplars for in-context learning). Dromedary\nsignificantly surpasses the performance of several state-of-the-art AI systems,\nincluding Text-Davinci-003 and Alpaca, on benchmark datasets with various\nsettings.",
