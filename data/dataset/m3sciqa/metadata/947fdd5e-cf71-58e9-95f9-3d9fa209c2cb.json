    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive emergent abilities in natural\nlanguage processing, but their democratization is hindered due to huge\ncomputation requirements and closed-source nature. Recent research on advancing\nopen-source smaller LMs by distilling knowledge from black-box LLMs has\nobtained promising results in the instruction-following ability. However, the\nreasoning ability which is more challenging to foster, is relatively rarely\nexplored. In this paper, we propose a tailored learning approach to distill\nsuch reasoning ability to smaller LMs to facilitate the democratization of the\nexclusive reasoning ability. In contrast to merely employing LLM as a data\nannotator, we exploit the potential of LLM as a reasoning teacher by building\nan interactive multi-round learning paradigm. This paradigm enables the student\nto expose its deficiencies to the black-box teacher who then can provide\ncustomized training data in return. Further, to exploit the reasoning potential\nof the smaller LM, we propose self-reflection learning to motivate the student\nto learn from self-made mistakes. The learning from self-reflection and LLM are\nall tailored to the student's learning status, thanks to the seamless\nintegration with the multi-round learning paradigm. Comprehensive experiments\nand analysis on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method.
