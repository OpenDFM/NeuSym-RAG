    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm for relation prediction in knowledge graphs involves\nlearning and operating on latent representations (i.e., embeddings) of entities\nand relations. However, these embedding-based methods do not explicitly capture\nthe compositional logical rules underlying the knowledge graph, and they are\nlimited to the transductive setting, where the full set of entities must be\nknown during training. Here, we propose a graph neural network based relation\nprediction framework, GraIL, that reasons over local subgraph structures and\nhas a strong inductive bias to learn entity-independent relational semantics.\nUnlike embedding-based models, GraIL is naturally inductive and can generalize\nto unseen entities and graphs after training. We provide theoretical proof and\nstrong empirical evidence that GraIL can represent a useful subset of\nfirst-order logic and show that GraIL outperforms existing rule-induction\nbaselines in the inductive setting. We also demonstrate significant gains\nobtained by ensembling GraIL with various knowledge graph embedding methods in\nthe transductive setting, highlighting the complementary inductive bias of our\nmethod.",
