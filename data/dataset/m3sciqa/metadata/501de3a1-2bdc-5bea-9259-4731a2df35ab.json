    "abstract": "Media organizations bear great reponsibility because of their considerable\ninfluence on shaping beliefs and positions of our society. Any form of media\ncan contain overly biased content, e.g., by reporting on political events in a\nselective or incomplete manner. A relevant question hence is whether and how\nsuch form of imbalanced news coverage can be exposed. The research presented in\nthis paper addresses not only the automatic detection of bias but goes one step\nfurther in that it explores how political bias and unfairness are manifested\nlinguistically. In this regard we utilize a new corpus of 6964 news articles\nwith labels derived from adfontesmedia.com and develop a neural model for bias\nassessment. By analyzing this model on article excerpts, we find insightful\nbias patterns at different levels of text granularity, from single words to the\nwhole article discourse.",
