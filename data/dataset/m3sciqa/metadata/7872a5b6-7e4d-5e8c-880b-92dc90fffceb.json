    "abstract": "Modern machine learning research relies on relatively few carefully curated\ndatasets. Even in these datasets, and typically in `untidy' or raw data,\npractitioners are faced with significant issues of data quality and diversity\nwhich can be prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing methods for\ndealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the\nparticular issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata\nsuch as domain labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead\nfocus on providing a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology\n-- uncovering and inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate\ndifferent subsets of data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled,\natypical, or out-of-distribution examples) using simple transformations, and\nleverage differences in learning dynamics between these probe suites to infer\nmetadata of interest. Our method is on par with far more sophisticated\nmitigation methods across different tasks: identifying and correcting\nmislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples, prioritizing points\nrelevant for training and enabling scalable human auditing of relevant\nexamples.",
