    "abstract": "Multilingual pre-trained language models can learn task-specific abilities or\nmemorize facts across multiple languages but inevitably make undesired\npredictions with specific inputs. Under similar observation, model editing aims\nto post-hoc calibrate a model targeted to specific inputs with keeping the\nmodel's raw behavior. However, existing work only studies the monolingual\nscenario, which lacks the cross-lingual transferability to perform editing\nsimultaneously across languages. In this work, we focus on cross-lingual model\nediting. Firstly, we define the cross-lingual model editing task and\ncorresponding metrics, where an edit in one language propagates to the others.\nNext, we propose a framework to naturally adapt monolingual model editing\napproaches to the cross-lingual scenario using parallel corpus. Further, we\npropose language anisotropic editing to improve cross-lingual editing by\namplifying different subsets of parameters for each language. On the newly\ndefined cross-lingual model editing task, we empirically demonstrate the\nfailure of monolingual baselines in propagating the edit to multiple languages\nand the effectiveness of the proposed language anisotropic model editing.
