    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive multilingual capability,\nbut their performance varies substantially across different languages. In this\nwork, we introduce a simple yet effective method, called cross-lingual-thought\nprompting (XLT), to systematically improve the multilingual capability of LLMs.\nSpecifically, XLT is a generic template prompt that stimulates cross-lingual\nand logical reasoning skills to enhance task performance across languages. We\nconduct comprehensive evaluations on 7 typical benchmarks related to reasoning,\nunderstanding, and generation tasks, covering both high-resource and\nlow-resource languages. Experimental results show that XLT not only remarkably\nenhances the performance of various multilingual tasks but also significantly\nreduces the gap between the average performance and the best performance of\neach task in different languages. Notably, XLT brings over 10 points of average\nimprovement in arithmetic reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks.",
