    "abstract": "Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models have shown remarkable\ncapabilities for natural language generation, but their performance for machine\ntranslation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of GPT models for machine translation, covering\nvarious aspects such as quality of different GPT models in comparison with\nstate-of-the-art research and commercial systems, effect of prompting\nstrategies, robustness towards domain shifts and document-level translation. We\nexperiment with eighteen different translation directions involving high and\nlow resource languages, as well as non English-centric translations, and\nevaluate the performance of three GPT models: ChatGPT, GPT3.5\n(text-davinci-003), and text-davinci-002. Our results show that GPT models\nachieve very competitive translation quality for high resource languages, while\nhaving limited capabilities for low resource languages. We also show that\nhybrid approaches, which combine GPT models with other translation systems, can\nfurther enhance the translation quality. We perform comprehensive analysis and\nhuman evaluation to further understand the characteristics of GPT translations.\nWe hope that our paper provides valuable insights for researchers and\npractitioners in the field and helps to better understand the potential and\nlimitations of GPT models for translation.",
