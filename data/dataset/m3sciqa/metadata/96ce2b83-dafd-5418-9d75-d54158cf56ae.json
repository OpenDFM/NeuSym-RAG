    "abstract": "With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising\nautoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than\npretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However,\nrelying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between\nthe masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light\nof these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive\npretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by\nmaximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization\norder and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive\nformulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the\nstate-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under\ncomparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a\nlarge margin, including question answering, natural language inference,\nsentiment analysis, and document ranking.",
