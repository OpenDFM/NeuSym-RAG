    "abstract": "Research on Machine Translation (MT) has achieved important breakthroughs in\nseveral areas. While there is much more to be done in order to build on this\nsuccess, we believe that the language industry needs better ways to take full\nadvantage of current achievements. Due to a combination of factors, including\ntime, resources, and skills, businesses tend to apply pragmatism into their AI\nworkflows. Hence, they concentrate more on outcomes, e.g. delivery, shipping,\nreleases, and features, and adopt high-level working production solutions,\nwhere possible. Among the features thought to be helpful for translators are\nsentence-level and word-level translation auto-suggestion and auto-completion.\nSuggesting alternatives can inspire translators and limit their need to refer\nto external resources, which hopefully boosts their productivity. This work\ndescribes our submissions to WMT's shared task on word-level auto-completion,\nfor the Chinese-to-English, English-to-Chinese, German-to-English, and\nEnglish-to-German language directions. We investigate the possibility of using\npre-trained models and out-of-the-box features from available libraries. We\nemploy random sampling to generate diverse alternatives, which reveals good\nresults. Furthermore, we introduce our open-source API, based on CTranslate2,\nto serve translations, auto-suggestions, and auto-completions.",
