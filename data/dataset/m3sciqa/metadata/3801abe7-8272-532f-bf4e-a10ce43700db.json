    "abstract": "Entity type prediction is an important problem in knowledge graph (KG)\nresearch. A new KG entity type prediction method, named CORE (COmplex space\nRegression and Embedding), is proposed in this work. The proposed CORE method\nleverages the expressive power of two complex space embedding models; namely,\nRotatE and ComplEx models. It embeds entities and types in two different\ncomplex spaces using either RotatE or ComplEx. Then, we derive a complex\nregression model to link these two spaces. Finally, a mechanism to optimize\nembedding and regression parameters jointly is introduced. Experiments show\nthat CORE outperforms benchmarking methods on representative KG entity type\ninference datasets. Strengths and weaknesses of various entity type prediction\nmethods are analyzed.",
