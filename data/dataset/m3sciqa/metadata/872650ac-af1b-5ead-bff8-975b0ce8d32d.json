    "abstract": "Generative AI models exhibit remarkable potential; however, hallucinations\nacross various tasks present a significant challenge, particularly for longer\ninputs that current approaches struggle to address effectively. We introduce\nSCALE (Source Chunking Approach for Large-scale inconsistency Evaluation), a\ntask-agnostic model for detecting factual inconsistencies using a novel\nchunking strategy. Specifically, SCALE is a Natural Language Inference (NLI)\nbased model that uses large text chunks to condition over long texts. This\napproach achieves state-of-the-art performance in factual inconsistency\ndetection for diverse tasks and long inputs. Additionally, we leverage the\nchunking mechanism and employ a novel algorithm to explain SCALE's decisions\nthrough relevant source sentence retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that SCALE\noutperforms existing methods on both standard benchmarks and a new long-form\ndialogue dataset ScreenEval we constructed. Moreover, SCALE surpasses\ncompetitive systems in efficiency and model explanation evaluations. We have\nreleased our code and data publicly to GitHub.",
