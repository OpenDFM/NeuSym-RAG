    "abstract": "Distantly supervised named entity recognition (DS-NER) aims to locate entity\nmentions and classify their types with only knowledge bases or gazetteers and\nunlabeled corpus. However, distant annotations are noisy and degrade the\nperformance of NER models. In this paper, we propose a noise-robust prototype\nnetwork named MProto for the DS-NER task. Different from previous\nprototype-based NER methods, MProto represents each entity type with multiple\nprototypes to characterize the intra-class variance among entity\nrepresentations. To optimize the classifier, each token should be assigned an\nappropriate ground-truth prototype and we consider such token-prototype\nassignment as an optimal transport (OT) problem. Furthermore, to mitigate the\nnoise from incomplete labeling, we propose a novel denoised optimal transport\n(DOT) algorithm. Specifically, we utilize the assignment result between Other\nclass tokens and all prototypes to distinguish unlabeled entity tokens from\ntrue negatives. Experiments on several DS-NER benchmarks demonstrate that our\nMProto achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is now available\non Github.",
