    "abstract": "Linking pronominal expressions to the correct references requires, in many\ncases, better analysis of the contextual information and external knowledge. In\nthis paper, we propose a two-layer model for pronoun coreference resolution\nthat leverages both context and external knowledge, where a knowledge attention\nmechanism is designed to ensure the model leveraging the appropriate source of\nexternal knowledge based on different context. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe validity and effectiveness of our model, where it outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models by a large margin.",
