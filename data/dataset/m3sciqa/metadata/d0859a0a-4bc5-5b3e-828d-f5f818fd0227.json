    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) remains challenging when entity mentions can\nbe discontinuous. Existing methods break the recognition process into several\nsequential steps. In training, they predict conditioned on the golden\nintermediate results, while at inference relying on the model output of the\nprevious steps, which introduces exposure bias. To solve this problem, we first\nconstruct a segment graph for each sentence, in which each node denotes a\nsegment (a continuous entity on its own, or a part of discontinuous entities),\nand an edge links two nodes that belong to the same entity. The nodes and edges\ncan be generated respectively in one stage with a grid tagging scheme and\nlearned jointly using a novel architecture named Mac. Then discontinuous NER\ncan be reformulated as a non-parametric process of discovering maximal cliques\nin the graph and concatenating the spans in each clique. Experiments on three\nbenchmarks show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nresults, with up to 3.5 percentage points improvement on F1, and achieves 5x\nspeedup over the SOTA model.",
