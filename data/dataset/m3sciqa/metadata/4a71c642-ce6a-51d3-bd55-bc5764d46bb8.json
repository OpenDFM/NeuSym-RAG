    "abstract": "Recent advances in multimodal pre-trained models have significantly improved\ninformation extraction from visually-rich documents (VrDs), in which named\nentity recognition (NER) is treated as a sequence-labeling task of predicting\nthe BIO entity tags for tokens, following the typical setting of NLP. However,\nBIO-tagging scheme relies on the correct order of model inputs, which is not\nguaranteed in real-world NER on scanned VrDs where text are recognized and\narranged by OCR systems. Such reading order issue hinders the accurate marking\nof entities by BIO-tagging scheme, making it impossible for sequence-labeling\nmethods to predict correct named entities. To address the reading order issue,\nwe introduce Token Path Prediction (TPP), a simple prediction head to predict\nentity mentions as token sequences within documents. Alternative to token\nclassification, TPP models the document layout as a complete directed graph of\ntokens, and predicts token paths within the graph as entities. For better\nevaluation of VrD-NER systems, we also propose two revised benchmark datasets\nof NER on scanned documents which can reflect real-world scenarios. Experiment\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and suggest its potential\nto be a universal solution to various information extraction tasks on\ndocuments.",
