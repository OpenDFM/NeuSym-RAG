    "abstract": "Even though machine learning has become the major scene in dialogue research\ncommunity, the real breakthrough has been blocked by the scale of data\navailable. To address this fundamental obstacle, we introduce the Multi-Domain\nWizard-of-Oz dataset (MultiWOZ), a fully-labeled collection of human-human\nwritten conversations spanning over multiple domains and topics. At a size of\n$10$k dialogues, it is at least one order of magnitude larger than all previous\nannotated task-oriented corpora. The contribution of this work apart from the\nopen-sourced dataset labelled with dialogue belief states and dialogue actions\nis two-fold: firstly, a detailed description of the data collection procedure\nalong with a summary of data structure and analysis is provided. The proposed\ndata-collection pipeline is entirely based on crowd-sourcing without the need\nof hiring professional annotators; secondly, a set of benchmark results of\nbelief tracking, dialogue act and response generation is reported, which shows\nthe usability of the data and sets a baseline for future studies.",
