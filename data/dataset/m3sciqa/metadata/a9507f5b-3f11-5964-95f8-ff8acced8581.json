    "abstract": "Constituency parsing and nested named entity recognition (NER) are similar\ntasks since they both aim to predict a collection of nested and non-crossing\nspans. In this work, we cast nested NER to constituency parsing and propose a\nnovel pointing mechanism for bottom-up parsing to tackle both tasks. The key\nidea is based on the observation that if we traverse a constituency tree in\npost-order, i.e., visiting a parent after its children, then two consecutively\nvisited spans would share a boundary. Our model tracks the shared boundaries\nand predicts the next boundary at each step by leveraging a pointer network. As\na result, it needs only linear steps to parse and thus is efficient. It also\nmaintains a parsing configuration for structural consistency, i.e., always\noutputting valid trees. Experimentally, our model achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on PTB among all BERT-based models (96.01 F1 score) and competitive\nperformance on CTB7 in constituency parsing; and it also achieves strong\nperformance on three benchmark datasets of nested NER: ACE2004, ACE2005, and\nGENIA. Our code is publicly available at\n\\url{https://github.com/sustcsonglin/pointer-net-for-nested}.",
