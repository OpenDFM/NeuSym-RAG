    "abstract": "Offensive language detection is increasingly crucial for maintaining a\ncivilized social media platform and deploying pre-trained language models.\nHowever, this task in Chinese is still under exploration due to the scarcity of\nreliable datasets. To this end, we propose a benchmark --COLD for Chinese\noffensive language analysis, including a Chinese Offensive Language Dataset\n--COLDATASET and a baseline detector --COLDETECTOR which is trained on the\ndataset. We show that the COLD benchmark contributes to Chinese offensive\nlanguage detection which is challenging for existing resources. We then deploy\nthe COLDETECTOR and conduct detailed analyses on popular Chinese pre-trained\nlanguage models. We first analyze the offensiveness of existing generative\nmodels and show that these models inevitably expose varying degrees of\noffensive issues. Furthermore, we investigate the factors that influence the\noffensive generations, and we find that anti-bias contents and keywords\nreferring to certain groups or revealing negative attitudes trigger offensive\noutputs easier.",
