    "abstract": "Compositional generalization refers to a model's capability to generalize to\nnewly composed input data based on the data components observed during\ntraining. It has triggered a series of compositional generalization analysis on\ndifferent tasks as generalization is an important aspect of language and\nproblem solving skills. However, the similar discussion on math word problems\n(MWPs) is limited. In this manuscript, we study compositional generalization in\nMWP solving. Specifically, we first introduce a data splitting method to create\ncompositional splits from existing MWP datasets. Meanwhile, we synthesize data\nto isolate the effect of compositions. To improve the compositional\ngeneralization in MWP solving, we propose an iterative data augmentation method\nthat includes diverse compositional variation into training data and could\ncollaborate with MWP methods. During the evaluation, we examine a set of\nmethods and find all of them encounter severe performance loss on the evaluated\ndatasets. We also find our data augmentation method could significantly improve\nthe compositional generalization of general MWP methods. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/demoleiwang/CGMWP.",
