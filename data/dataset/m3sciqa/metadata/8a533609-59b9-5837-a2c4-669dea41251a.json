    "abstract": "We consider the problem of detecting out-of-distribution images in neural\nnetworks. We propose ODIN, a simple and effective method that does not require\nany change to a pre-trained neural network. Our method is based on the\nobservation that using temperature scaling and adding small perturbations to\nthe input can separate the softmax score distributions between in- and\nout-of-distribution images, allowing for more effective detection. We show in a\nseries of experiments that ODIN is compatible with diverse network\narchitectures and datasets. It consistently outperforms the baseline approach\nby a large margin, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on this\ntask. For example, ODIN reduces the false positive rate from the baseline 34.7%\nto 4.3% on the DenseNet (applied to CIFAR-10) when the true positive rate is\n95%.",
