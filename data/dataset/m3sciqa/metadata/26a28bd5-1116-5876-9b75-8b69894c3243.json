    "abstract": "We present CoDEx, a set of knowledge graph completion datasets extracted from\nWikidata and Wikipedia that improve upon existing knowledge graph completion\nbenchmarks in scope and level of difficulty. In terms of scope, CoDEx comprises\nthree knowledge graphs varying in size and structure, multilingual descriptions\nof entities and relations, and tens of thousands of hard negative triples that\nare plausible but verified to be false. To characterize CoDEx, we contribute\nthorough empirical analyses and benchmarking experiments. First, we analyze\neach CoDEx dataset in terms of logical relation patterns. Next, we report\nbaseline link prediction and triple classification results on CoDEx for five\nextensively tuned embedding models. Finally, we differentiate CoDEx from the\npopular FB15K-237 knowledge graph completion dataset by showing that CoDEx\ncovers more diverse and interpretable content, and is a more difficult link\nprediction benchmark. Data, code, and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://bit.ly/2EPbrJs.",
