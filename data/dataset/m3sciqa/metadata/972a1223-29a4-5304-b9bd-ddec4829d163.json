    "abstract": "Recent immense breakthroughs in generative models such as in GPT4 have\nprecipitated re-imagined ubiquitous usage of these models in all applications.\nOne area that can benefit by improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) is\nhealthcare. The note generation task from doctor-patient encounters, and its\nassociated electronic medical record documentation, is one of the most arduous\ntime-consuming tasks for physicians. It is also a natural prime potential\nbeneficiary to advances in generative models. However with such advances,\nbenchmarking is more critical than ever. Whether studying model weaknesses or\ndeveloping new evaluation metrics, shared open datasets are an imperative part\nof understanding the current state-of-the-art. Unfortunately as clinic\nencounter conversations are not routinely recorded and are difficult to\nethically share due to patient confidentiality, there are no sufficiently large\nclinic dialogue-note datasets to benchmark this task. Here we present the\nAmbient Clinical Intelligence Benchmark (ACI-BENCH) corpus, the largest dataset\nto date tackling the problem of AI-assisted note generation from visit\ndialogue. We also present the benchmark performances of several common\nstate-of-the-art approaches.",
