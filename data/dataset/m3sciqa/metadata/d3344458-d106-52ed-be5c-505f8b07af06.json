    "abstract": "We study response selection for multi-turn conversation in retrieval-based\nchatbots. Existing work either concatenates utterances in context or matches a\nresponse with a highly abstract context vector finally, which may lose\nrelationships among utterances or important contextual information. We propose\na sequential matching network (SMN) to address both problems. SMN first matches\na response with each utterance in the context on multiple levels of\ngranularity, and distills important matching information from each pair as a\nvector with convolution and pooling operations. The vectors are then\naccumulated in a chronological order through a recurrent neural network (RNN)\nwhich models relationships among utterances. The final matching score is\ncalculated with the hidden states of the RNN. An empirical study on two public\ndata sets shows that SMN can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods\nfor response selection in multi-turn conversation.",
