    "abstract": "Long-form numerical reasoning in financial analysis aims to generate a\nreasoning program to calculate the correct answer for a given question.\nPrevious work followed a retriever-generator framework, where the retriever\nselects key facts from a long-form document, and the generator generates a\nreasoning program based on retrieved facts. However, they treated all facts\nequally without considering the different contributions of facts with and\nwithout numbers. Meanwhile, the program consistency were ignored under\nsupervised training, resulting in lower training accuracy and diversity. To\nsolve these problems, we proposed APOLLO to improve the long-form numerical\nreasoning framework. For the retriever, we adopt a number-aware negative\nsampling strategy to enable the retriever to be more discriminative on key\nnumerical facts. For the generator, we design consistency-based reinforcement\nlearning and target program augmentation strategy based on the consistency of\nprogram execution results. Experimental results on the FinQA and ConvFinQA\nleaderboard verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving the new\nstate-of-the-art.",
