    "abstract": "On the world wide web, toxic content detectors are a crucial line of defense\nagainst potentially hateful and offensive messages. As such, building highly\neffective classifiers that enable a safer internet is an important research\narea. Moreover, the web is a highly multilingual, cross-cultural community that\ndevelops its own lingo over time. As such, it is crucial to develop models that\nare effective across a diverse range of languages, usages, and styles. In this\npaper, we present the fundamentals behind the next version of the Perspective\nAPI from Google Jigsaw. At the heart of the approach is a single multilingual\ntoken-free Charformer model that is applicable across a range of languages,\ndomains, and tasks. We demonstrate that by forgoing static vocabularies, we\ngain flexibility across a variety of settings. We additionally outline the\ntechniques employed to make such a byte-level model efficient and feasible for\nproductionization. Through extensive experiments on multilingual toxic comment\nclassification benchmarks derived from real API traffic and evaluation on an\narray of code-switching, covert toxicity, emoji-based hate, human-readable\nobfuscation, distribution shift, and bias evaluation settings, we show that our\nproposed approach outperforms strong baselines. Finally, we present our\nfindings from deploying this system in production.",
