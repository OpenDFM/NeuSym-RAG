    "abstract": "To build open-domain chatbots that are able to use diverse communicative\nskills, we propose a novel framework BotsTalk, where multiple agents grounded\nto the specific target skills participate in a conversation to automatically\nannotate multi-skill dialogues. We further present Blended Skill BotsTalk\n(BSBT), a large-scale multi-skill dialogue dataset comprising 300K\nconversations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our dataset\ncan be effective for multi-skill dialogue systems which require an\nunderstanding of skill blending as well as skill grounding. Our code and data\nare available at https://github.com/convei-lab/BotsTalk.",
