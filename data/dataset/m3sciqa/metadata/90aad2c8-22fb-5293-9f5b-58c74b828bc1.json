    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new natural language processing (NLP) application for\nidentifying medical jargon terms potentially difficult for patients to\ncomprehend from electronic health record (EHR) notes. We first present a novel\nand publicly available dataset with expert-annotated medical jargon terms from\n18K+ EHR note sentences ($MedJ$). Then, we introduce a novel medical jargon\nextraction ($MedJEx$) model which has been shown to outperform existing\nstate-of-the-art NLP models. First, MedJEx improved the overall performance\nwhen it was trained on an auxiliary Wikipedia hyperlink span dataset, where\nhyperlink spans provide additional Wikipedia articles to explain the spans (or\nterms), and then fine-tuned on the annotated MedJ data. Secondly, we found that\na contextualized masked language model score was beneficial for detecting\ndomain-specific unfamiliar jargon terms. Moreover, our results show that\ntraining on the auxiliary Wikipedia hyperlink span datasets improved six out of\neight biomedical named entity recognition benchmark datasets. Both MedJ and\nMedJEx are publicly available.",
