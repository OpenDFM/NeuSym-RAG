    "abstract": "Reasoning over natural language is a long-standing goal for the research\ncommunity. However, studies have shown that existing language models are\ninadequate in reasoning. To address the issue, we present POET, a novel\nreasoning pre-training paradigm. Through pre-training language models with\nprograms and their execution results, POET empowers language models to harvest\nthe reasoning knowledge possessed by program executors via a data-driven\napproach. POET is conceptually simple and can be instantiated by different\nkinds of program executors. In this paper, we showcase two simple instances\nPOET-Math and POET-Logic, in addition to a complex instance, POET-SQL.\nExperimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate that POET can significantly\nboost model performance in natural language reasoning, such as numerical\nreasoning, logical reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. POET opens a new gate on\nreasoning-enhancement pre-training, and we hope our analysis would shed light\non the future research of reasoning like program executors.",
