    "abstract": "We present the first multi-task learning model -- named PhoNLP -- for joint\nVietnamese part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) and\ndependency parsing. Experiments on Vietnamese benchmark datasets show that\nPhoNLP produces state-of-the-art results, outperforming a single-task learning\napproach that fine-tunes the pre-trained Vietnamese language model PhoBERT\n(Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) for each task independently. We publicly release\nPhoNLP as an open-source toolkit under the Apache License 2.0. Although we\nspecify PhoNLP for Vietnamese, our PhoNLP training and evaluation command\nscripts in fact can directly work for other languages that have a pre-trained\nBERT-based language model and gold annotated corpora available for the three\ntasks of POS tagging, NER and dependency parsing. We hope that PhoNLP can serve\nas a strong baseline and useful toolkit for future NLP research and\napplications to not only Vietnamese but also the other languages. Our PhoNLP is\navailable at: https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoNLP",
