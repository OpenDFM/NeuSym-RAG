    "abstract": "With the increased use of social media platforms by people across the world,\nmany new interesting NLP problems have come into existence. One such being the\ndetection of sarcasm in the social media texts. We present a corpus of tweets\nfor training custom word embeddings and a Hinglish dataset labelled for sarcasm\ndetection. We propose a deep learning based approach to address the issue of\nsarcasm detection in Hindi-English code mixed tweets using bilingual word\nembeddings derived from FastText and Word2Vec approaches. We experimented with\nvarious deep learning models, including CNNs, LSTMs, Bi-directional LSTMs (with\nand without attention). We were able to outperform all state-of-the-art\nperformances with our deep learning models, with attention based Bi-directional\nLSTMs giving the best performance exhibiting an accuracy of 78.49%.",
