    "abstract": "Patient portal allows discharged patients to access their personalized\ndischarge instructions in electronic health records (EHRs). However, many\npatients have difficulty understanding or memorizing their discharge\ninstructions. In this paper, we present PaniniQA, a patient-centric interactive\nquestion answering system designed to help patients understand their discharge\ninstructions. PaniniQA first identifies important clinical content from\npatients' discharge instructions and then formulates patient-specific\neducational questions. In addition, PaniniQA is also equipped with answer\nverification functionality to provide timely feedback to correct patients'\nmisunderstandings. Our comprehensive automatic and human evaluation results\ndemonstrate our PaniniQA is capable of improving patients' mastery of their\nmedical instructions through effective interactions",
