    "abstract": "Natural question generation (QG) aims to generate questions from a passage\nand an answer. Previous works on QG either (i) ignore the rich structure\ninformation hidden in text, (ii) solely rely on cross-entropy loss that leads\nto issues like exposure bias and inconsistency between train/test measurement,\nor (iii) fail to fully exploit the answer information. To address these\nlimitations, in this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based\ngraph-to-sequence (Graph2Seq) model for QG. Our model consists of a Graph2Seq\ngenerator with a novel Bidirectional Gated Graph Neural Network based encoder\nto embed the passage, and a hybrid evaluator with a mixed objective combining\nboth cross-entropy and RL losses to ensure the generation of syntactically and\nsemantically valid text. We also introduce an effective Deep Alignment Network\nfor incorporating the answer information into the passage at both the word and\ncontextual levels. Our model is end-to-end trainable and achieves new\nstate-of-the-art scores, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin\non the standard SQuAD benchmark.",
