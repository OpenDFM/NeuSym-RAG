    "abstract": "The proliferation of misleading information in everyday access media outlets\nsuch as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers have made it\nchallenging to identify trustworthy news sources, thus increasing the need for\ncomputational tools able to provide insights into the reliability of online\ncontent. In this paper, we focus on the automatic identification of fake\ncontent in online news. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce two\nnovel datasets for the task of fake news detection, covering seven different\nnews domains. We describe the collection, annotation, and validation process in\ndetail and present several exploratory analysis on the identification of\nlinguistic differences in fake and legitimate news content. Second, we conduct\na set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors. In\naddition, we provide comparative analyses of the automatic and manual\nidentification of fake news.",
