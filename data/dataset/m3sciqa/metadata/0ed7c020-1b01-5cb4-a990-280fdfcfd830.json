    "abstract": "Ultra-fine entity typing (UFET) is the task of inferring the semantic types,\nfrom a large set of fine-grained candidates, that apply to a given entity\nmention. This task is especially challenging because we only have a small\nnumber of training examples for many of the types, even with distant\nsupervision strategies. State-of-the-art models, therefore, have to rely on\nprior knowledge about the type labels in some way. In this paper, we show that\nthe performance of existing methods can be improved using a simple technique:\nwe use pre-trained label embeddings to cluster the labels into semantic domains\nand then treat these domains as additional types. We show that this strategy\nconsistently leads to improved results, as long as high-quality label\nembeddings are used. We furthermore use the label clusters as part of a simple\npost-processing technique, which results in further performance gains. Both\nstrategies treat the UFET model as a black box and can thus straightforwardly\nbe used to improve a wide range of existing models.",
