    "abstract": "Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety\nof tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or\nonly apply single granular (word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In\nthis work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model\nunder the \"matching-aggregation\" framework. Given two sentences $P$ and $Q$,\nour model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two\nencoded sentences in two directions $P \\rightarrow Q$ and $P \\leftarrow Q$. In\neach matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all\ntime-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another\nBiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length\nmatching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, the decision is made\nthrough a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks:\nparaphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence\nselection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our\nmodel achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.",
