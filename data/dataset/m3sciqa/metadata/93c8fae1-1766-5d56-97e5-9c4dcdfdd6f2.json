    "abstract": "Using data-driven models for solving text summarization or similar tasks has\nbecome very common in the last years. Yet most of the studies report basic\naccuracy scores only, and nothing is known about the ability of the proposed\nmodels to improve when trained on more data. In this paper, we define and\npropose three data efficiency metrics: data score efficiency, data time\ndeficiency and overall data efficiency. We also propose a simple scheme that\nuses those metrics and apply it for a more comprehensive evaluation of popular\nmethods on text summarization and title generation tasks. For the latter task,\nwe process and release a huge collection of 35 million abstract-title pairs\nfrom scientific articles. Our results reveal that among the tested models, the\nTransformer is the most efficient on both tasks.",
